$Abstract=Wildfires have nearly become a guaranteed annual event in most western National Forests. Severe fire effects can be mitigated with a goal of minimizing the hydrologic response and promoting soil and vegetation recovery towards the pre-disturbance condition. Sometimes, post-fire actions include salvage logging to recover timber value and to remove excess fuels. Salvage logging was conducted after three large wildfires on the Lolo National Forest in Montana, USA, between 2017 and 2019. We evaluated detrimental soil disturbance (DSD) on seven units that were burned at low, moderate, and high soil burn severity in 2022, three to five years after the logging occurred. We found a range of exposed soil of 5%–25% and DSD from 3% to 20%, and these values were significantly correlated at r = 0.88. Very-high-resolutionWorldView-2 imagery that coincided with the field campaign was used to calculate Normal Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) across the salvaged areas; we found that NDVI values were significantly correlated to DSD at r = 0.87. We were able to further examine this relationship and determined NDVI threshold values that corresponded to high-DSD areas, as well as develop a model to estimate the contributions of equipment type, seasonality, topography, and burn severity to DSD. A decision-making tool which combines these factors and NDVI is presented to support land managers in planning, evaluating, and monitoring disturbance from post-fire salvage logging.

$Abstract=A study was carried out to compare runoff and erosion from natural rainfall on plots that had been treated with prescribed fire to unburned plots on a sagebrush-steppe rangeland in Southeast Idaho, U.S. Prescribed fire on rangeland sites is intended to maintain healthy shrub-steppe ecosystems but sometimes results in undesirable consequences such as increased runoff and soil erosion. Information is lacking on plot-scale erosion studies from natural precipitation in this ecosystem. Such plot-scale studies are needed to better understand sediment sources (uplands or channels) to support the management and modeling of rangeland watersheds. In this study, there were two treatments: four prescribed burn plots and three adjacent unburned control plots. Runoff and erosion were measured from natural rainfall for water years (WY) 2004 to 2010 following a prescribed burn in October 2003. Runoff and erosion were also measured from nearby unburned plots for WY 2005–2010. Ground cover on the burned plots averaged 57% (standard error (s.e. = 4%) in the summer of 2004, compared to 95% (s.e. = 5%) on the unburned plots. By the end of the study in 2010, ground cover had increased to 81% (s.e. = 4%) on the burned plots but decreased to 74% (s.e. = 5%) on the unburned plots. Annual runoff averaged 6 mm (s.e. = 7) from four burned plots, compared to 34 mm (s.e. = 8.7) from three unburned plots. In WY 2006, high rates of runoff from snowmelt on the unburned plots resulted in 122 mm (s.e. = 16) of runoff compared to only 12 mm (s.e. = 14) of runoff from the burned plots. An analysis of variance showed significant differences in runoff due to either precipitation (p = 0002) or year (p = 0.004) and treatment (burned vs. unburned; p=0.03). There were also significant differences in seasonal runoff (p = 0.05), as 90% of the measured runoff occurred in the spring, with all large runoff events associated with snowmelt. Erosion on the burned plots averaged 233 kg ha-1 (s.e. = 21) compared to 133 kg ha-1 (s.e. = 29) on the unburned plots. From two years after the burn and for the remainder of the study, there were no significant differences in erosion between burned and unburned plots (p < 0.05). Future studies are needed to link upland runoff and erosion with channel deposition, erosion, and sediment delivery, and more detailed studies on erosion associated with snowmelt on rangelands are needed to aid in the development of watershed modeling tools. Future studies should include observations of plant community regeneration in addition to ground cover, runoff, and sediment delivery.

$Abstract=In Elliot and Flanagan (2023), the interrill and rill soil erodibility of 36 cropland soils was reported, along with correlations among soil erodibility and other soil properties, and equations to estimate erodibility from readily measured soil properties. Early versions of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model had linked interrill detachment rate to the square of the rainfall intensity and an interrill soil erodibility constant Ki1. By the time the WEPP model was released for general use in 1995, the developers had changed the interrill detachment rate to be a function of the product of rainfall intensity and runoff and a different interrill erodibility constant, Ki2. The interrill erodibilities (Ki2) with this altered relationship were not the same as Ki1 values developed to support earlier releases of the WEPP model. The authors, when reviewing some of the past literature supporting Elliot and Flanagan (2023), had mistakenly reported Ki2 values when the numbers reported were in fact Ki1 values. A closer examination of the entire data set and the identification of a published source for the correct Ki2 values confirmed this mistake. This corrigendum reports the corrected Ki2 values, the correlation of those revised values with other soil properties, and confirmation of a 1995 regression equation relating Ki2 to three readily measured soil properties: sand content, very fine sand content, and clay content. The coefficient of determination for the 1995 regression equation was 0.80. We recommend that all references to Ki2 in Elliot and Flanagan (2023) be changed to Ki1 except the discussion about the findings of Mirzaee and Ghorbani-Dashtaki (2021), discussion about Ki2 in Alberts et al. (1995), and equations 2 and A16.

$Abstract=Post-fire salvage logging using ground-based heavy equipment can impact soils and vegetation, and lead to various effects that can increase or decrease post-fire runoff and erosion (removal of soil or sediment from its initial position). This document briefly outlines the current understanding of these effects and provides an overview of best management practices (BMPs) designed to mitigate the negative effects related to sediment delivery to streams and other aquatic resources. It is based on the best available scientific information regarding BMPs that may be used to reduce sediment delivery from post-fire salvage logging activities as well as the authors’ knowledge on this topic. The document is intended to complement state, regional, and national regulations and/or guidance for timber harvest activities in unburned and burned forests (California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE), 2023; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2005; USDA Forest Service, 2000, 2012). This document focuses on implementation on lands subject to California’s Forest Practice Rules (FPRs), although the process-based approach allows more broad application of this guidance with appropriate caution, including consideration for climate, landscape setting, and operational conditions or constraints. The primary audience for this document is forestry and watershed professionals. Abbreviated operational guidance will be provided for licensed timber operators in a subsequent product. Research results informing the various effects and guidance are provided in reference materials. No attempt is made to address the ecological aspects of post-fire salvage logging, which are covered elsewhere. Site preparation for reforestation can occur with or without salvage logging, but few studies have addressed the effects of those practices on runoff and erosion (Cole et al., 2020). Similarly, this document does not address best management practices for fire suppression repair, although some of the practices presented herein may apply to suppression repair activities.

$Abstract=The mobilization of potentially harmful chemical constituents in wildfire ash can be a major consequence of wildfires, posing widespread societal risks. Knowledge of wildfire ash chemical composition is crucial to anticipate and mitigate these risks. Here we present a comprehensive dataset on the chemical characteristics of a wide range of wildfire ashes (42 types and a total of 148 samples) from wildfires across the globe and examine their potential societal and environmental implications. An extensive review of studies analysing chemical composition in ash was also performed to complement and compare our ash dataset. Most ashes in our dataset had an alkaline reaction (mean pH 8.8, ranging between 6 and 11.2). Important constituents of wildfire ash were organic carbon (mean: 204 g kg􀀀 1), calcium, aluminium, and iron (mean: 47.9, 17.9 and 17.1 g kg􀀀 1). Mean nitrogen and phosphorus ranged between 1 and 25 g kg􀀀 1, and between 0.2 and 9.9 g kg􀀀 1, respectively. The largest concentrations of metals of concern for human and ecosystem health were observed for manganese (mean: 1488 mg kg􀀀 1; three ecosystems > 1000 mg kg􀀀 1), zinc (mean: 181 mg kg􀀀 1; two ecosystems > 500 mg kg􀀀 1) and lead (mean: 66.9 mg kg􀀀 1; two ecosystems > 200 mg kg􀀀 1). Burn severity and sampling timing were key factors influencing ash chemical characteristics like pH, carbon and nitrogen concentrations. The highest readily dissolvable fractions (as a % of ash dry weight) in water were observed for sodium (18 %) and magnesium (11.4 %). Although concentrations of elements of concern were very close to, or exceeded international contamination standards in some ashes, the actual effect of ash will depend on factors like ash loads and the dilution into environmental matrices such as water, soil and sediment. Our approach can serve as an initial methodological standardization of wildfire ash sampling and chemical analysis protocols.

$Abstract=The 2019 Museum Fire burned in a mountainous region near the city of Flagstaff, AZ, USA. Due to the high risk of post-fire debris flows and flooding entering the city, we deployed a network of seismometers within the burn area and downstream drainages to examine the efficacy of seismic monitoring for post-fire flows. Seismic instruments were deployed during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 monsoon seasons following the fire and recorded several debris flow and flood events, as well as signals associated with rainfall, lightning and wind. Signal power, frequency content, and wave polarization were measured for multiple events and compared to rain gauge records and images recorded by cameras installed in the study area. We use these data to test the efficacy of seismic recordings to (a) detect and differentiate between different energy sources, (b) estimate the timing of lightning strikes, (c) calculate rainfall intensities, and (d) determine debris flow timing, size, velocity, and location. We then calculate forward models of seismic signals associated with debris flows and rainfall to better interpret our results and characterize these events. Our observations and modeling show that we can differentiate between these sources and that seismic data can provide insight into post-fire debris flow characteristics, including relative particle sizes and velocity.

$Abstract=Wildfires can dramatically modify the hydrologic and erosion response of ecosystems, increasing risks to population and assets downslope of fire affected hillslopes. This applies especially to volcanic areas in fire-prone regions which often exhibit steep terrain and high population densities. However, the effects of fire on key hydrologic and erosion parameters, which are critical for modelling runoff-erosion processes, predicting related post-fire risks and for selecting effective mitigation measures, have not been extensively assessed in this terrain type. Here we evaluate water erosion processes of two contrasting volcanic soils in recently burned forest areas of Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) at hillslope scale using erosion plots monitoring and rill erosion simulation experiments. The results show that both the lithology and the degree of weathering of the volcanic material govern the post-fire water erosion by concentrated flow (rill erosion experiments) and by the combination of interrill and rill erosion (erosion plots). Mature volcanic soils showed less susceptibility to erosion than weakly weathered volcanic soils and soils with non-volcanic lithologies. The results also show that the availability of easily detachable and transportable soil particles swiftly decreases after the fire, leading to the exhaustion of sediments and a decrease of the erosion rates with cumulative runoff events. These findings have direct implications for the modelling of runoff-erosion processes in volcanic terrain.

$Abstract=Increased wildfire activity in the western United States can lead to detrimental cascading effects to water quality. After fires, burned areas may experience significant runoff-induced erosion and sediment transport into rivers and reservoirs, which could rapidly overwhelm existing drinking water treatment plants. This paper couples an assessment of wildfire risk with an evaluation of water utility preparedness to understand where key fire-related drinking water vulnerabilities exist. Wildfire risk assessments were constructed and expanded from a commonly used methodology codeveloped between researchers and water managers (Edel et al., 2002), to understand drinking water impacts on water quality after wildfires. A water utility preparedness index was created for this study using publicly available information to contextualize how well utilities may be able to respond to water quality degradation after fires. Results indicate that 22% of utilities studied (10% of the population served) were underprepared for fire and 11% of watersheds used were at greater risk of wildfire (9% of the population served). However, nearly three-quarters of utilities (76% of the population served) showed a moderate risk of fire and some need for improved fire preparedness. Information developed here could provide a useful framework from which utility managers can better assess their likely wildfire risk and preparation plans.

$Abstract=The purposes of this study were to support a watershed modeling analysis by evaluating the ability to the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to estimate sediment generated by high traffic gravel roads, and to determine the erodibility of two designs of high-traffic gravel roads. In many watersheds, the road network can be a major source of sediment. The ability to predict erosion from roads, evaluate the effects of design and management on road sedimentation, and compare sediment from roads to other sources of sediment in the watershed is an ongoing need by watershed managers. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is a widely used model for predicting sediment from forest roads. There has, however, been little information published on erosion from high traffic gravel roads and WEPP applications to such roads. To evaluate road erosion predictions, a study was conducted incorporating two road designs at Fort Benning, Georgia, U.S. One design followed a common practice of starting with a native material road and adding gravel and grading as required. Erosion and rutting on the road surface were common occurrences on this type of road. The improved design was a “graded aggregate base” design, built with compacted aggregate layers. To evaluate erosion risks for these two road designs, runoff and sediment delivery were measured from ten plots ranging in size from 63 to 150 m2. Runoff depths up to 50 mm occurred from daily rainfall amounts up to nearly 60 mm, with least square mean event runoff values of 6.5 mm from unimproved plots and 14.9 mm from improved road plots. Delivered sediment ranged from zero to 18 Mg ha-1 from individual storms with least square mean amounts of 2.27 Mg ha-1 of sediment delivered from unimproved road plots compared to only 0.026 Mg ha-1 delivered from improved road design plots for a given runoff event. Hydraulic conductivity was found by calibration to be 3.0 mm h-1 for unimproved roads and 1.3 mm h-1 for improved road segments. Rill erodibility was 0.09 s m-1 for unimproved roads and 0.0008 s m-1 for improved roads, values that were greater than had been measured on road erosion studies elsewhere that were typically less than 0.0004 s m-1. The critical shear for the unimproved roads was the minimum that the WEPP model would accept, 0.0001 Pa, but was a more typical value of 1.5 Pa for the improved road segments. When applying the calibrated erodibility values to a validation data set, the Willmott indices of agreement were 0.62 and 0.82 for runoff for unimproved and improved roads, respectively, and 0.67 and 0.66 for sediment delivery from unimproved and improved roads, respectively, indicating good agreement between observed and WEPP-estimated runoff and erosion rates. A sensitivity analysis and calibration analysis found that the WEPP model was not sensitive to interrill erosion for this application. A sensitivity analysis coupled with a WEPP validation analysis showed that WEPP could incorporate weather, topography, soil, and road design features to predict sediment delivery from highly erodible road segments. The study suggests that there is a need for a simulated runoff study to determine high values of rill erodibility more precisely on unimproved high traffic roads, and that there is a need to incorporate more erodible road erodibility values into the online WEPP:Road interface for the WEPP model. The road erosion rates and effectiveness of improved road designs for reducing off-road sediment reported in this study will be useful to managers seeking to quantify and reduce road erosion.

$Abstract=In the late 1980s, the USDA Agricultural Research Service, along with other federal agencies and multiple universities, collaborated to develop a new physically based soil erosion model, the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Model. The WEPP model was intended to replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation and was to include estimates for upland runoff and erosion, sediment delivery to first order channels, and runoff and sediment routing through a down-stream channel network. The WEPP technology estimated erosion from raindrop splash and sheet flow (interrill erosion) and concentrated channel flow (rill erosion). To make these erosion estimates, WEPP required new soil erodibility values for interrill erodibility (Ki). rill erodibility (Kr), and critical shear (𝜏𝜏c) for concentrated flow erosion. The WEPP Core team determined that they needed to estimate these three erodibility values from measurable soil properties for a wide range of soil conditions. To develop relationships between WEPP soil erodibility variables and other soil properties, a field study was carried out using rainfall and runoff simulation to measure the three erodibility values for 36 soils. Sites were identified on croplands from Washington to Georgia and Maine to California, USA for erodibility measurement. Concurrently, the USDA Soil Conservation Service (SCS) carried out detailed soil surveys and laboratory analyses for all sites to provide a large database of soil physical, chemical, and engineering properties. Correlation and regression analyses were carried out to develop relationships between SCS measurable soil properties and WEPP soil erodibility values. This article provides a summary of the field procedures, data analyses, and subsequent predictive equations that were developed. The predictive equations that were finalized in the WEPP User Summary used sand, very fine sand, clay, and organic carbon contents to predict cropland soil erodibility, but the Coefficient of Determination (r2) values were 0.55 or less. More complex predictive equations were developed with soil physical, chemical, mineralogical, and geomorphic properties, with r2 values up to 0.81. Most of the better predictive equations included terms for soil texture and clay mineralogy, often with additional chemical properties. A set of simplified erodibility equations using only the readily available properties of soil texture, organic car-bon, cation exchange capacity, slope steepness, and taxonomic order were derived for use within the WEPP Model, with r2 values greater than 0.5 for all three equations for estimating soil erodibility from measurable soil properties.

$Abstract=Post wildfire forests are dynamic environments. Wetting-induced shallow landslides are observed at varying times after wildfires, but the reasons are not fully known. This study investigates the time-dependent changes in soil properties and mechanical and hydrologic soil behavior of hillslopes after the 2019 Williams Flats Wildfire near Keller, WA and demonstrates the implications of these changes to slope stability. Soil water repellency, organic content, fine content, soil water retention curve, hydraulic conductivity, friction angle, and in-situ suction-saturation data provides initial evidence that soil properties fluctuate over a year after the wildfire. The results therefore suggest that soil properties that are measured immediately after the wildfire are misleading for long-term slope stability analysis. The stability of a steep (45°) slope is found to be most affected by the fluctuations in friction angle and soil water retention over the year. The comparison of suction saturation response near a burned and unburned location demonstrates the effects of macropores that are formed after the wildfire and evapotranspiration on slope stability. The hillslope stability at the unburned location reduces rapidly in April upon snowmelt, whereas the stability at the burned location, which has macropores, shows the rapid decrease in late-January, with the onset of snowfall.

$Abstract=We developed a new online interface for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model (WEPPcloud) with a framework that allows the incorporation and development of several other models and applications to make hydrologic models more accessible to land managers and facilitate the decision-making process. All inputs to WEPP, such as topography, soils, land use, and weather, are automatically created from publicly available online international databases and converted into input formats readable by the model. The WEPPcloud interface can be applied to forested, cropland, and rangeland conditions, but it is specialized for undisturbed forest conditions, post-wildfire, and pre- and post-wildfire management scenarios such as forest thinning, prescribed fire, or postwildfire mulching. Users only need a computer or device with a web browser and an internet connection to perform advanced hydrologic simulations. All the model runs are stored remotely on WEPPcloud, which can be accessed by the users at any given time. This modeling tool is presented in two parts: Part I: Model description and parameterization, and Part II: Model performance assessment and applications to forest management and wildfires.

$Abstract=Wildfire is a major driver of nitrogen (N) cycling and export from terrestrial to aquatic systems. While fire is a natural process in many watersheds, it can still degrade water quality by rapidly flushing N to streams. This can be particularly problematic in watersheds that experience high levels of N deposition or where climate change is promoting larger and more severe fires. The extent and duration of postfire N export, and the potential consequences for downstream water quality, depend on how N inputs, internal cycling, and outputs vary before, during, and after fire. Here we review the major factors controlling N cycling and retention in forests and adjacent shrublands, and how fire modifies these controls. We connect burned slopes to streams to describe how fire exports N to aquatic environments. We also consider the implications for municipal watersheds and water resources management. We close by identifying critical knowledge gaps in projecting how fire will affect watershed N cycling and retention in the future.

$Abstract=Suspended sediment and nutrients following forest management activities or wildfires are transported to streams and lakes via surface runoff and are a major threat to water quality. Land and water managers resort to hydrologic models to test hypotheses that can help them make informed decisions to minimize disturbances and protect water resources. We present applications of an online interface, WEPPcloud, for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model as a pre- and post-disturbance management tool to model various gauged and ungauged forested watersheds throughout the western U.S. We compare simulated streamflow, sediment, and phosphorus to observations at USGS gauging stations and assess the accuracy of the online interface with minimal or no calibration. Specifically, we present modeling results from 28 relatively undisturbed forested watersheds in the states of California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Across all watersheds, the NSEs based on the daily streamflow values, were in the range of 0.43 to 0.64 indicating satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed values. Similarly, annual average NSE for sediment yield was 0.61, while for phosphorus it was 0.75, 0.71, and 0.66, for total, particulate, and soluble reactive phosphorus, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of the WEPPcloud interface as a tool to compare model results for ungauged watersheds from various disturbed conditions including prescribed fire, thinning, and wildfire to undisturbed model results to better understand the effects of forest management and wildfires on water quality and quantity.

$Abstract=The WEPPcloud interface is a new online decision-support tool for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model that facilitates data preparation and model runs, and summarizes model outputs into tables and maps that are easily interpretable by users. The interface can be used by land and water managers in the United States, Europe, and Australia interested in simulating streamflow, sediment and pollutant loads from both undisturbed and disturbed (e.g. post- wildfire or post-treatment such as thinning or prescribed fires) forested watersheds. This article contains full hydro- logic model runs for 28 forested watersheds in the U.S. Pacific Northwest with the WEPPcloud online interface. It also includes links to repositories with the individual model runs, a table containing default model parameters for disturbed conditions, and figures with model outputs as compared to observed data. The data in the repositories include all the raw data input and output from the model as well as the processed data, which can be accessed through tables and shapefiles to provide additional insights into the model out- puts. Lastly, the article describes how the data are organized and the content of each folder containing the data. These model runs are useful for anyone interested in modeling forested watersheds with the WEPPcloud interface.

$Abstract=Effective watershed management and protection of water resources from non-point source pollution require identification, prioritization, and targeting of pollutant source areas. Process-based hydrology and water quality models are powerful heuristic tools for land and water resources managers. However, because of their complexity, such models are often under-utilized as management prioritization and planning tools. In this paper, we present a prioritization, interactive visualization, and analysis tool (Pi-VAT) that is programmed to synthesize multi-scenario, multi-watershed outputs from process-based geospatial models. We demonstrate the utility of Pi- VAT to examine simulated hydrologic, sediment, and water quality response at the hillslope/hydrologic response unit (HRU) scale. We apply Pi-VAT to output from multiple watersheds and for multiple management scenarios and treatments from two geospatial models for watershed management: Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) and Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). Pi-VAT was developed using the Shiny web application framework for the R programming language. In a matter of minutes, Pi-VAT can synthesize overwhelming amounts of output from process-based models into information useful for land and water resources managers. We illustrate the use of Pi-VAT to interactively identify, quantify, and visualize areas that are most susceptible to disturbance under different scenarios and provide a synthesis approach based on land use, soil type, and slope steepness. This approach guides land and water resources managers in prioritizing the areas of the watershed that provide the maximum reduction in pollutant loads while treating the least amount of area. Pi-VAT provides a flexible reactive platform for the development of decision support tools based on process-based models intended for watershed management and research applications.

$Abstract=The USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) is a process-based soil erosion prediction model. WEPP uses three soil erodibility parameters: rill erodibility (Kr), interrill erodibility (Ki), and critical hydraulic shear stress (τc). In this study, a new parameterization approach for estimating erodibility was developed for WEPP applications on rangelands. Data from overland flow experiments on disturbed and undisturbed rangelands were used to develop empirical equations to predict rill erodibility variation as a function of vegetation cover and soil texture. Data from rainfall simulation experiments were analyzed by piecewise regression to develop empirical equations for predicting the variability of interrill erodibility before and after disturbance and across a wide range of soil textures as a function of vegetation cover and soil texture. Critical shear values corresponding to the developed rill and interrill erodibility parameters were proposed. Our results show that the new erodibility approach predicts erosion at the plot scale with a satisfactory range of error (PBIAS =35.6 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.49). The new approach was used to provide soil erodibility values for the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT), which uses WEPP as the runoff and erosion calculation engine.

$Abstract=As wildland fires amplify in size in many regions in the western USA, land and water
managers are increasingly concerned about the deleterious effects on drinking water supplies.
Consequences of severe wildfires include disturbed soils and areas of thick ash cover, which raises
the concern of the risk of water contamination via ash. The persistence of ash cover and depth
were monitored for up to 90 days post-fire at nearly 100 plots distributed between two wildfires
in Idaho and Washington, USA. Our goal was to determine the most �cost� effective, operational
method of mapping post-wildfire ash cover in terms of financial, data volume, time, and processing
costs. Field measurements were coupled with multi-platform satellite and aerial imagery collected
during the same time span. The image types spanned the spatial resolution of 30 m to sub-meter
(Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, WorldView-2, and a drone), while the spectral resolution spanned visible
through SWIR (short-wave infrared) bands, and they were all collected at various time scales. We
that found several common vegetation and post-fire spectral indices were correlated with ash cover
(r = 0.6�0.85); however, the blue normalized difference vegetation index (BNDVI) with monthly
Sentinel-2 imagery was especially well-suited for monitoring the change in ash cover during its
ephemeral period. A map of the ash cover can be used to estimate the ash load, which can then be
used as an input into a hydrologic model predicting ash transport and fate, helping to ultimately
improve our ability to predict impacts on downstream water resources.

$Abstract=Active wildfire seasons in the western U.S. warrant the evaluation of post-fire
forest management strategies. Ground-based salvage logging is often used to
recover economic loss of burned timber. In unburned forests, ground-based logging
often follows best management practices by leaving undisturbed areas near
streams called stream buffers. However, the effectiveness of these buffers has
not been tested in a post-wildfire setting. This experiment tested buffer width
effectiveness with a novel field-simulated rill experiment using sediment-laden
runoff (25 g/L) released over 40 min at evenly timed flow rates (50, 100 and
150 L/min) to measure surface runoff travel length and sediment concentration
under unburned and high and low soil burn severity conditions at 2-, 10- and
22-month post-fire. High severity areas 2-month post-fire had rill lengths of up
to 100 m. Rill length significantly decreased over time as vegetation regrowth
provided ground cover. Sediment concentration and sediment dropout rate also
varied significantly by soil burn severity. Sediment concentrations were 19 g/L
for the highest flow 2-month post-fire and reduced to 6.9�14 g/L 10-month
post-fire due to abundant vegetation recovery. The amount of sediment
dropping out of the flow consistently increased over the study period with the
low burn severity rate of 1.15 g L-1 m-1 approaching the unburned rate of
1.29 g L-1 m-1 by 2-year post-fire. These results suggest that an often-used
standard, 15 m buffer, was sufficient to contain surface runoff and reduce sediment
concentration on unburned sites, however buffers on high burn severity
sites need to be eight times greater (120 m) immediately after wildfire and four
times greater (60 m) 1-year post-fire. Low burn severity areas 1-year post-fire
may need to be only twice the width of an unburned buffer (30 m), and 2-year
post-fire these could return to unburned widths.

$Abstract=Post-wildfire changes to hydrologic and geomorphic systems can lead to widespread
sediment redistribution. Understanding how sediment moves through a watershed is crucial for assessing
hazards, developing debris flow inundation models, engineering sediment retention solutions, and
quantifying the role that disturbances play in landscape evolution. In this study, we used terrestrial and
airborne lidar to measure sediment redistribution in the 2016 Fish Fire, in the San Gabriel Mountains
in southern California, USA. The lidar areas are in two adjacent watersheds, at spatial scales of 900 m2
to 4 km2, respectively. Terrestrial lidar data were acquired prior to rainfall, and two subsequent surveys
show erosional change after rainstorms. Two airborne lidar flights occurred (1) 7 months before, and
(2) 14 months after the fire ignition, capturing the erosional effects after rainfall. We found hillslope
erosion dominated the overall sediment budget in the first rainy season after wildfire. Only 7% of the total
erosion came from the active channel bed and channel banks, and the remaining 93% of eroded sediment
was derived from hillslopes. Within the channelized portion of the watershed erosion/deposition could
be generally described with topographic metrics used in a stream power equation. Observed sediment
volumes were compared with four empirical models and one process-based model. We found that the
best predictions of sediment volume were obtained from an empirical model developed in the same
physiographic region. Moreover, this study showed that post-wildfire erosion rates in the San Gabriel
Mountains attain the same magnitude as millennial time scale bedrock erosion rates.

$Abstract=Sediment delivery following post-fire logging is a concern relative to water quality.
While studies have assessed the effect of post-fire logging on sediment yields at different
spatial scales, none have explicitly identified sediment sources. Our goal was
to quantify post-fire and post-salvage logging sediment yields and use rill patterns to
identify sediment sources. We measured the extent and type of logging disturbance,
length of rills per unit area or �rill density�, ground cover, and sediment yields in nine
logged and five control small catchments or �swales�, 0.09 to 0.81 ha, for 5 years
after the 2013 Rim Fire in California's Sierra Nevada. The logged swales had a mean
ground disturbance of 31%. After the first wet season following logging, there
was no difference in either mean rill density (0.071 and 0.088 m m-2, respectively)
or mean transformed, normalized sediment yields between the control and logged
swales. Untransformed mean sediment yields across three sites ranged from
0.11�11.8 and 1.1�3.2 Mg ha-1 for the controls and salvage-logged swales, respectively.
Rill density was strongly related to sediment yield and increased significantly
with the amount of high-traffic skid trail disturbance in logged swales. Rill density
was not significantly related to the amount of bare soil despite a significant relationship
between sediment yields and bare soil. Rills usually initiated in bare soil and frequently
connected high traffic skid trails to the drainage network after being diverted
by waterbars. Rill connectivity and sediment yields decreased in control and logged
swales where vegetation or other surface cover was high, suggesting this cover disconnected
rills from the drainage network. Increasing ground cover on skid trails and
between areas disturbed by post-fire logging and stream channels may reduce sediment
yields as well as the hydrologic connectivity between hillslopes and the drainage
network.

$Abstract=The 2019/2020 Australian bushfires (or wildfires) burned the largest forested area in Australia's recorded history, with major
socio-economic and environmental consequences. Among the largest fires was the 280 000 ha Green Wattle Creek Fire,
which burned large forested areas of the Warragamba catchment. This protected catchment provides critical ecosystem
services for Lake Burragorang, one of Australia's largest urban supply reservoirs delivering ~85% of the water used in Greater
Sydney. Water New South Wales (WaterNSW) is the utility responsible for managing water quality in Lake Burragorang. Its
postfire risk assessment, done in collaboration with researchers in Australia, the UK, and United States, involved (i) identifying
pyrogenic contaminants in ash and soil; (ii) quantifying ash loads and contaminant concentrations across the burned area;
and (iii) estimating the probability and quantity of soil, ash, and associated contaminant entrainment for different rainfall
scenarios. The work included refining the capabilities of the new WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU model (Water Erosion Prediction
Project cloud-Wildfire Ash Transport And Risk-Australia) for predicting sediment, ash, and contaminant transport, aided by
outcomes from previous collaborative postfire research in the catchment. Approximately two weeks after the Green Wattle
Creek Fire was contained, an extreme rainfall event (~276mm in 72 h) caused extensive ash and sediment delivery into the
reservoir. The risk assessment informed on-ground monitoring and operational mitigation measures (deployment of debriscatching
booms and adjustment of the water supply system configuration), ensuring the continuity of safe water supply to
Sydney. WEPPcloud-WATAR-AU outputs can prioritize recovery interventions for managing water quality risks by quantifying
contaminants on the hillslopes, anticipating water contamination risk, and identifying areas with high susceptibility to ash and
sediment transport. This collaborative interaction among scientists and water managers, aimed also at refining model
capabilities and outputs to meet managers' needs, exemplifies the successful outcomes that can be achieved at the interface
of industry and science.

$Title=From burned slopes to streams: how wildfire affects nitrogen cycling and retention in forests and fire-prone watersheds
$Year=2021
$Authors=Robichaud, Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=Springer
$Abstract=Wildfire is a major driver of nitrogen
(N) cycling and export from terrestrial to aquatic
systems. While fire is a natural process in many
watersheds, it can still degrade water quality by
rapidly flushing N to streams. This can be particularly
problematic in watersheds that experience high levels
of N deposition or where climate change is promoting
larger and more severe fires. The extent and duration
of postfire N export, and the potential consequences
for downstream water quality, depend on how N
inputs, internal cycling, and outputs vary before,
during, and after fire. Here we review the major factors
controlling N cycling and retention in forests and
adjacent shrublands, and how fire modifies these
controls. We connect burned slopes to streams to
describe how fire exports N to aquatic environments.
We also consider the implications for municipal
watersheds and water resources management. We
close by identifying critical knowledge gaps in
projecting how fire will affect watershed N cycling
and retention in the future

$Title=Effectiveness of post-fire soil erosion mitigation treatments: A systematic review and meta-analysis
$Year=2021

$Abstract=Wildfires are known to be one of the main causes of soil erosion and land degradation, and their impacts on ecosystems and society are expected to increase in the future due to changes in climate and land use. It is therefore vital to mitigate the increased hydrological and erosive response after wildfires to maintain the sustainability of ecosystems and protect the values at risk downstream from the fire-affected areas. Soil erosion mitigation treatments have been widely applied after wildfires but assessment of their effectiveness has been limited to local and regional-scale studies, whose conclusions may depend heavily on site-specific conditions. To overcome this limitation, a meta-analysis approach was applied to investigations of post-wildfire soil erosion mitigation treatments published in peer-reviewed journals. A meta-analysis database was compiled that consisted of 53 and 222 pairs of treated/untreated observations on post-fire runoff and erosion, respectively, extracted from 34 publications indexed in Scopus. The overall effectiveness of mitigation treatments, expressed as the quantitative metric �effect size�, was determined for both the runoff and erosion observations, and further analyzed for four different types of treatments (cover-based, barriers, seeding, and chemical treatments). The erosion observations involving cover-based treatments were analyzed for differences in effectiveness between 3 different types of mulch materials (straw, wood-based, and hydromulch) as well as between different application rates of straw and wood materials. Finally, the erosion observations were also analyzed for the overall effectiveness of post-fire year, burn severity, rainfall amount and erosivity, and ground cover. The meta-analysis results show that all four types of treatments significantly reduced post-fire soil erosion, but that only the cover and barrier treatments significantly reduced post-fire runoff. From the three different cover treatments, straw and wood mulches were significantly more effective in mitigating erosion than hydromulch. In addition, the effectiveness of both straw and wood mulches depended on their application rates. Straw mulching was less effective at rates below than above 200�g�m-2, while mulching with wood materials at high rates (1300 to 1750�g�m-2) produced more variable outcomes than lower rates. Results also suggest that the overall effectiveness of the treatments was greatest shortly after fire, in severely burned sites, providing or promoting the development of ground cover over 70%, and that it increased with increasing rainfall erosivity. It can be concluded that, in overall terms, the application of the studied post-fire erosion mitigation treatments represented a better choice than doing nothing, especially in sites where erosion is high. However, the meta-analysis highlights under-representation of studies on this topic outside of the USA, Spain and Portugal. It was also observed that most of the studies were conducted at hillslope scale and tested mulching (namely straw, wood and hydromulch) and/or barriers, while larger scales and other treatments were scarcely addressed. Further efforts need to be made in testing, from field and modeling studies, combinations of existing and/or emerging erosion mitigation treatments to ensure that the most adequate measures are applied after fires.

$Abstract=Post-wildfire erosion and the slope instability issues associated with it are a global problem that can negatively affect transportation corridors, the environment, and human life. Currently, mulch treatments are commonly used means of stabilizing wildfire-burnt hillslopes; however, mulch, especially agricultural straw mulch, can pose environmental concerns related to invasive plants. An environmentally friendly treatment, xanthan gum (XG), and a commercial polyacrylamide (PAM) were evaluated as alternatives for stabilizing surficial silty soil that was burnt by the 2018 Mesa Fire in central Idaho to reduce runoff-dominated erosion. Indoor rainfall experiments were conducted to simulate three wet-dry cycles. Runoff and infiltration were measured after each wetting and drying event, and used to compare the effectiveness of the admixture. The total runoff at the end of three wetting events increased slightly, by * 4% for PAM and * 12% for XG. These results indicate that both PAM and XG decrease soil oloss and infiltration, but that neither seals the soil surface completely. The soil loss during each wetting event was found to be dependent on the water content before wetting and the corresponding regime in the soil water retention curve. PAM and XG maintained the unsaturated state in soil, with water contents consistently around 30% before the second and third wetting events. This resulted in similar runoffs and statistically significant reductions in soil loss. At the end of three events, the soil loss was reduced by 2.9 times for XG and 6.9 times for PAM, compared to the soil loss from untreated soil.

$Abstract=Post-fire managers throughout the world use predictive models to estimate potential erosion risks to aid in evaluating downstream impacts of increased runoff and erosion, and to target critical areas within a fire for applying mitigation practices. Erosion prediction can be complicated by forest road networks. Using GIS technology and a soil erosion model, this study evaluated the effect of roads on erosion and sediment yield following a wildfire, and whether the predictive models were providing reasonable results. The GeoWEPP model was used to simulate onsite erosion and offsite sediment delivery before and after fire disturbance. A 2-m resolution DEM was used as the terrain layer. Erosion rates in excess of 4 Mg ha-1yr-1 were predicted mainly from the moderate and high severity burn areas. Roads influenced both flow path and sub-catchment delineations, affecting the spatial distribution of sediment detachment and transport. Through that influence, roads tended to reduce estimated erosion on slopes below the roads, but road fillslopes and steep channels were areas of significant increases in erosion risks. Measured deposition amounts along roads and in sediment basins were similar to predicted amounts. The results confirm that road prisms, culverts and road ditches greatly influence sedimentation processes after wildfire, and they present opportunities to detain eroded sediments before they reach downstream water bodies.

$Abstract=There is a wide range of postwildfire preparedness and mitigation activities that can and often do take place on the hillslopes, in the channels, and within the communities themselves. The physical mitigation efforts are guided by hydrologic models that account for changes in erosion, sediment delivery, and runoff in response to wildfire disturbances to the soil properties and overlying vegetation(Robichaud and Ashmun 2013). The workshop focused more on the modeling, alerting, and public warning of hydrologic responses given forecasts or estimates of rainfall in real time rather than using design rainstorms for planning purposes. The overarching goal of the workshop was to develop a dialogue among the partners to share tools and techniques for forecasting flash floods, severe erosion, and debris flows in response to intense rainfall, to highlight research and development needs for improving prediction, and to identify both short- and long-term methodologies that can be considered for transitioning to operational weather forecasting centers.

$Abstract=Wildfire is a natural component of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe rangelands that induces temporal shifts in plant
community physiognomy, ground surface conditions, and erosion rates. Fire alteration of the vegetation structure and ground cover in these ecosystems commonly amplifies soil losses by wind- and water-driven erosion. Much of the fire-related erosion research for sagebrush steppe has focused on either erosion by wind over gentle terrain or water-driven erosion under high-intensity rainfall on complex topography. However, many sagebrush rangelands are geographically positioned in snow-dominated uplands with complex terrain in which runoff and sediment delivery occur primarily in winter months associated with cold-season hydrology. Current understanding is limited regarding fire effects on the interaction of wind- and cold-season hydrologic-driven erosion processes for these ecosystems. In this study, we evaluated fire impacts on vegetation, ground cover, soils, and erosion across spatial scales at a snowdominated mountainous sagebrush site over a 2-year period post-fire. Vegetation, ground cover, and soil conditions were assessed at various plot scales (8m2 to 3.42 ha) through standard field measures. Erosion was quantified through a network of silt fences (n = 24) spanning hillslope and side channel or swale areas, ranging from 0.003 to 3.42 ha in size. Sediment delivery at the watershed scale (129 ha) was assessed by suspended sediment samples of streamflow through a drop-box v-notch weir. Wildfire  consumed nearly all above-ground live vegetation at the site and resulted in more than 60% bare ground (bare soil, ash, and rock) in the immediate post-fire period.Widespread wind-driven sediment loading of swales was observed over the first month post-fire and extensive snow drifts were formed in these swales each winter season during the study. In the first year, sediment yields from north- and south-facing aspects averaged 0.998.62 t h1 at the short-hillslope scale (~0.004 ha), 0.021.65 t h1 at the long-hillslope scale (0.020.46 ha), and 0.24 0.71 t h1 at the swale scale (0.653.42 ha), and watershed scale sediment yield was 2.47 t h1. By the second year post fire, foliar cover exceeded 120% across the site, but bare ground remained more than 60%. Sediment yield in the second year was greatly reduced across short- to long-hillslope scales (0.020.04 t h1), but was similar to first-year measures for swale plots (0.240.61 t h1) and at the watershed scale (3.05 t h1). Nearly all the sediment collected across all spatial scales was delivered during runoff events associated with cold-season hydrologic processes, including rain-on-snow, rain-on-frozen soils, and snowmelt runoff. Approximately 8599% of annual sediment collected across all silt fence plots each year was from swales. The high levels of sediment delivered across hillslope to watershed scales in this study are attributed to observed preferential loading of fine sediments into swale channels by aeolian processes in the immediate post-fire period and subsequent flushing of these sediments by runoff from cold-season hydrologic processes. Our results suggest that the interaction of aeolian and cold-season hydrologic-driven erosion processes is an important component for consideration in post-fire erosion assessment and prediction and can have profound implications for soil loss from these ecosystems.

$Abstract=Continuing long and extensive wildfire seasons in the Western US emphasize the need for better understanding of wildfire impacts including post-fire management scenarios. Advancements in our understanding of post-fire hillslope erosion and watershed response such as flooding, sediment yield, and debris flows have recently received considerable attention. The potential impacts of removing dead trees, called salvage logging, has been studied, however the use of remotely sensed imagery after salvage logging to evaluate spatial patterns and recovery is novel. The 2015 North Star Fire provided an opportunity to evaluate hillslope erosion reduction using two field experiments and coincidental remotely sensed imagery over 3 years. Simulated rill experiments with four flow rates were used to quantify hillslope erosion on skidder trails with and without added logging slash compared with a burned-only control. Seven replicated hillslope silt fence plots with the same treatments were also evaluated for natural rainfall events. WorldView-2 satellite imagery was used to relate ground cover and erodible bare soil between the two experiments using multi-temporal Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) values. Results indicate that the skid trails produced significantly more sediment (0.70 g s1) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.34 g s1) or controls (0.04 g s1) with the simulated rill experiment. Similarly, under natural rainfall conditions sediment yield from hillslope silt fence plots was significantly greater for the skid trail (3.42 Mg ha1) than either the slash treated skid trail (0.18 Mg ha1) or controls (0 Mg ha1). An NDVI value of 0.32 on all plots over all years corresponded to a ground cover of about 60% which is an established threshold for erosion reduction. Significant relationships between NDVI, ground cover, and sediment values suggest that NDVI may help managers evaluate ground cover and erosion potential remotely after disturbances such as a wildfire or salvage logging.

$Abstract=Active wildfire seasons in the western U.S. warrant the evaluation of post-fire forest management strategies. Ground-based salvage logging is often used to recover economic loss of burned timber. In unburned forests, ground-based logging often follows best management practices by leaving undisturbed areas near streams called stream buffers. However, the effectiveness of these buffers has not been tested in a post-wildfire setting. This experiment tested buffer width effectiveness with a novel field-simulated rill experiment using sediment-laden runoff (25 g/L) released over 40 min at evenly timed flow rates (50, 100 and 150 L/min) to measure surface runoff travel length and sediment concentration under unburned and high and low soil burn severity conditions at 2-, 10- and 22-month post-fire. High severity areas 2-month post-fire had rill lengths of up to 100 m. Rill length significantly decreased over time as vegetation regrowth provided ground cover. Sediment concentration and sediment dropout rate also varied significantly by soil burn severity. Sediment concentrations were 19 g/L for the highest flow 2-month post-fire and reduced to 6.914 g/L 10-month post-fire due to abundant vegetation recovery. The amount of sediment dropping out of the flow consistently increased over the study period with the low burn severity rate of 1.15 g L1 m1 approaching the unburned rate of 1.29 g L1 m1 by 2-year post-fire. These results suggest that an often-used standard, 15 m buffer, was sufficient to contain surface runoff and reduce sediment concentration on unburned sites, however buffers on high burn severity sites need to be eight times greater (120 m) immediately after wildfire and four times greater (60 m) 1-year post-fire. Low burn severity areas 1-year post-fire may need to be only twice the width of an unburned buffer (30 m), and 2-year post-fire these could return to unburned widths.

$Abstract=Large wildfires can have profound and lasting impacts not only from direct consumption of vegetation but also longerterm effects such as persistent soil erosion. The 2002 Hayman Fire burned in one of the watersheds supplying water to the Denver metropolitan area; thus there was concern regarding hillslope erosion and sedimentation in the reservoirs. The efficacy of various treatments for reducing erosion was tested, including hand scarification on contour, agricultural straw mulch, wood mulch, burned controls and unburned reference plots. Simulated rill erosion experiments were used both immediately after the fire and again 10 years post fire. To better understand untreated recovery, the same experiments were applied to control plots in post-fire years 1, 2, 3 and 4, and in unburned reference plots in years 4 and 10. Results indicate that control and scarified plots produced significantly greater sediment flux rates � 1.9 and 2.8 g s1 respectively � than the straw and wood mulch treatments � 0.9 and 1.1 g s1 � immediately after the fire. Mulch treatments reduced runoff rate, runoff velocity, and sediment concentration and flux rate. The straw mulch cover was no longer present, whereas the wood mulch was still there in year 10. Vegetation regrowth was slow and mulch treatments provided effective cover to reduce sediment right after the fire. In post-fire year 10, there were no significant differences in sediment flux rates across treatments; it is notable, however, that the wood mulch treatment (0.09 g s1) most closely approached the unburned condition (0.07 g s1). The burned control plots had high sediment flux rates until post-fire year 3, when flux rates significantly decreased and were statistically no longer higher than the unburned levels from year 4 and 10. These results will inform managers of the longer-term post-fire sediment delivery rates and of the ability of post-fire emergency hillslope treatments to mitigate erosion rates. Published 2019.

$Abstract=Wildfires are known to change post-fire watershed conditions such that hillslopes can become prone to increased erosion and sediment delivery. In this work, we coupled wildfire spread and erosion prediction modelling to assess the benefits of fuel reduction treatments in preventing soil runoff. The study was conducted in a 68 000-ha forest area located in Sardinia, Italy. We compared no-treatment conditions v. alternative strategic fuel treatments performed in 15% of the area. Fire behaviour before and after treatments was estimated by simulating 25 000 wildfires for each condition using the minimum travel time fire-spread algorithm. The fire simulations replicated historic conditions associated with severe wildfires in the study area. Sediment delivery was then estimated using the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT). Our results showed how post-fire sediment delivery varied among and within fuel treatment scenarios. The most efficient treatment alternative was that implemented near the road network. We also evaluated other factors such as exceedance probability, time since fire, slope, fire severity and vegetation type on post-fire sediment delivery. This work provides a quantitative assessment approach to inform and optimise proactive risk management activities intended to reduce post-fire erosion.

$Abstract=Post-fire flooding and elevated sediment loads in channels can pose hazards to people and structures within the wildland-urban interface. Mitigation of these hazards is essential to protect downstream resources. Straw bale check dams are one treatment designed to reduce sediment yields in small ephemeral catchments (b2 ha).
This study investigated their effectiveness in five paired catchments burned at high severity during the 2010
Twitchell Canyon Fire in Utah. Rainfall, ground cover and hillslope erosion rates were also measured during
the two-year study. Adjacent paired catchments were physically similar and ranged in size from 0.2 to 1.6 ha
across pairs. Within pairs, one catchment was an untreated control and the other treated at a rate of four
strawbale check dams ha-1. High intensity rainfall, erodible soils and slowregrowth contributed to the observed
high hillslope sediment yields (N 60 Mg ha-1). 1- and 2-yr I30 return period rain events early in the study quickly
filled the strawbale check dams indicating the treatment did not statistically reduce annual sediment yields. First
year annual sediment yields across all catchments were 19.6 to 25.7 Mg ha-1. Once the check dams were full,
they had limited storage capacity during the second post-fire year, allowing 3.8 to 13.1 Mg ha-1 of sediment
to pass over the check dams. The mean mass of sediment trapped by individual straw bale check dams was
1.3 Mg, which allowed them to trap a mean of 5.9 Mg ha-1 of sediment at the given treatment rate. Straw bale
check dams trapped b50% of the total mass delivered from catchments with efficiency decreasing over time. Increasing straw bale check damtreatment rate in stable channels may improve trap efficiency. Application of this
treatment in areas with lower expected rainfall intensities and less erodible soils may be justifiable.

$Abstract=Erosion of soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) following severe wildfire may have deleterious effects on
downstream resources and ecosystem recovery. Although C and N losses in combustion and runoff have been studied
extensively, soil C and N transported by post-fire erosion has rarely been quantified in burned landscapes. To better understand the magnitude and temporal pattern of these losses, we analysed the C and N content of sediment collected in severely burned hillslopes and catchments across the western USA over the first 4 post-fire years. We also compared soil C and N losses from areas receiving common erosion-mitigation treatments and untreated, burned areas. The concentrations of C andNin the eroded material (0.23�0.98 g C kg 1 and 0.01�0.04 gNkg
1) were similar to those of mineral soils rather than organic soil horizons or combusted vegetation. Losses of eroded soil C and N were highly variable across sites, and were highest the first 2 years after fire. Cumulative erosional losses from untreated, burned areas ranged from 73 to 2253 kg C ha 1 and from 3.3 to 110 kgNha 1 over 4 post-fire years. Post-fire erosion-mitigation treatments reduced C and Nlosses by up to 75% compared with untreated areas. Losses in post-fire erosion are estimated to be,10% of the total soil C and N combusted during severe wildfire and ,10% of post-fire soil C and N stocks remaining in the upper 20 cm of
mineral soil. Although loss of soil C and N in post-fire erosion is unlikely to impair the productivity of recovering vegetation, export of C and N may influence downstream water quality and aquatic ecosystems.

$Abstract=Post-fire assessment is made after a wildfire incident to provide details about damage level and its distribution over burned areas. Such assessments inform restoration plans and future monitoring of ecosystem recovery. Due to the high cost and time to conduct fieldwork, remote sensing is an appealing alternative to assess post-fire condition over larger areas than can be surveyed practically in the field. The aim of this study is to use remote sensing data to characterize post-fire severity at tree level in a mixed conifer forest following the Cascade and East Zone megafires of 2007 in central Idaho, USA. We used remote sensing metrics derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data (2008) and high-resolution QuickBird (QB) multispectral satellite imagery (2007�2009) for calibrating and validating predictive models with field data (2008). We compared fire effects on trees in open canopies within recent fuel treatments to similar trees in closed canopies on adjacent, untreated sites. We observed more trees with charred crowns in high fire severity sites, mostly untreated, whereas we observed more trees with live crowns in low fire severity sites, independent of the treatment. Individual trees were more accurately detected from ALS data in treated sites with open canopies than untreated sites with closed canopies. For detected trees, the response variables predicted from ALS and QB metrics were total height (Ht), crown base height (CBH), total basal area (BAT), live basal area (BAL), scorched basal area (BAS), charred basal area (BAC) and crown severity (CS). None of the selected QB metrics were strongly correlated with the selected ALS metrics, which justified combining both data types into the predictive models. Random Forest regression models combining ALS+QB metrics or using ALS metrics alone performed similarly but clearly better than models using only QB metrics. This study shows the superiority of ALS data to high resolution, multispectral QB imagery for mapping fire severity at tree level. Managers with limited resources to plan for restoration of fire affected forests are advised to prioritize spending for data collection on ALS data and a modest number of field inventory plots, rather than QB or other broadband satellite imagery.

$Abstract=Following high-severity wildfire, application of mulch on the soil surface is commonly used to stabilize slopes and limit soil erosion potential, protecting ecosystem values at risk. Despite the widespread use of mulch, relatively little is known about its effects on ecosystem recovery and soil processes important for plant re-establishment. Following a high-severity wildfire in a Colorado lodgepole pine forest, we studied the effects of both mulch material and application rate on plant recovery and the relative importance of soil abiotic conditions and microbial substrate availability as drivers of plant community development over the first four years of recovery. Mulches were applied to experimental plots in a randomized complete block design immediately following the High Park Fire in July 2012. Treatments included wheat straw, wood strands, and wood shreds applied at two coverage rates (standard and high). Two controls, non-mulched and a microbially-neutral synthetic mulch, were included in each block to assess the relative importance of mulch effects on abiotic versus biotic dynamics. Plant and soil monitoring occurred at least annually for four-years post fire. Understory plants increased in total cover and shifted in composition over time, but these trends were largely unaffected by mulch type or application rate. Non-native understory plant species were not abundant at the end of this experiment, but their cover was higher in plots treated with wheat straw and high-rate wood strands compared to non-mulched control. Lodgepole pine seedling densities were higher in wood shred and mulched control treatments than in wheat straw and non-mulched control treatments. Because there were few effects of mulch treatments on plant available nitrogen, it is likely that effects of mulch on soil abiotic conditions (moisture and temperature) drove ecosystem responses in this system. Our findings indicate wood mulches can provide soil protection for many years and accelerate lodgepole pine establishment following wildfire with few negative near-term effects on plant recovery. In systems such as this, post-fire application of wood mulch can help managers meet site protection goals with minimal impacts on plant recovery.

$Abstract=Background: Straw mulching is one of the most common treatments applied immediately post fire to reduce soil erosion potential and mitigate post-fire effects on water quality, downstream property, and infrastructure, but little is known about the long-term effects on vegetation response. We sampled six fires that were mulched between 9 and 13 years ago in western US dry conifer forests. We compared understory plant species diversity and
abundance, tree seedling density and height by species, and fractional ground cover on mulched and unmulched
paired plots.
Results: Mulch did not influence understory plant diversity, species richness, or fractional ground cover. However, on mulched plots, tree seedlings grew taller faster, especially on north-facing aspects, and there was slightly more graminoid cover. Mulch did not affect overall tree seedling density, but there were fewer ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson & C. Lawson) and more Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) in mulched areas, especially on south-facing slopes.
Conclusions: Managers will be able to weigh the long-term implications of mulching against the short-term reductions
in soil erosion potential. While there are many concerns about vegetation suppression and exotic species introduction from using straw mulch, our study suggests that the long-term effects are subtle 9 to 13 years after post-fire mulching.

$Abstract=Water crises�defined as significant declines in water quality and quantity�top the global risks list compiled by the 
World Economic Forum (2015) that have the greatest potential impacts on society. Vegetation fires are amongst the most
hydrologically significant landscape disturbances (Ebel & Mirus, 2014) and affect ~4% of the global vegetated land surface 
annually (Giglio, Randerson, & van der Werf, 2013). A substantial body of hydrological research exists on fire impacts
on soil-, hillslope- and, to a lesser extent, catchment-scale processes with a focus on infiltration, runoff, erosion, and water yield
(Moody, Shakesby, Robichaud, Cannon, & Martin, 2013; Shakesby & Doerr, 2006; Shakesby, Moody, Martin, & Robichaud, 2016).
However, despite the concerns highlighted above, research has only recently focused on linkages between on-site and downstream impacts
of fire on water quality. Despite their economic and environmental significance, it is still difficult to sufficiently predict
the probability and magnitude of post-fire contaminant exports to enable (a) reliable water contamination risk assessments 
in fire-prone catchments and (b) support effective mitigation strategies (Shakesby, 2011; Shakesby et al., 2016; Verkaik et al., 2013).
This commentary introduces such a framework within which we highlight (a) the dominant limitations to our capacity to evaluate
post-fire water contamination risk and (b) recent advances towards addressing them across a range of post-fire environments. This
framework embodies the science required to broaden the scope and maximize the utility of such investigations, whilst enabling meaningful
comparison between studies and addressing site-specific and end user-focused priorities.

$Abstract=Wildfires naturally occur worldwide, however the potential disruption to ecosystem services from subsequent
post-fire flooding and erosion often necessitates a response from land managers. The impact of high severity wildfire on
infiltration and interrill erosion responses was evaluated for five years after the 2003 Hot Creek Fire in Idaho, USA.
Relative infiltration from mini-disk tension infiltrometers (MDI) was compared to rainfall simulation measurements on
small burned and control plots. Vegetation recovery was slow due to the severity of the fire, with median cover of 6�8%
on burned sites after 5 years. Consequently, interrill sediment yields remained significantly higher on the burned sites
(329�1200 g m�2) compared to the unburned sites (3�35 g m�2) in year 5. Total infiltration on the burned plots increased
during the study period, yet were persistently lower compared to the control plots. Relative infiltration measurements
made at the soil surface, and 1- and 3-cm depths were significantly correlated to non-steady state total infiltration values
taken in the first 10 minutes of the hour-long rainfall simulations. Significant correlations were found at the 1-cm (? =
0.4�0.6) and 3-cm (? = 0.3�0.6) depths (most p-values <0.001), and somewhat weaker correlations at the soil surface
(? = 0.2�0.4) (p-values <0.05 and up). Soil water repellency is often stronger below the soil surface after severe wildfire,
and likely contributes to the reduced infiltration. These results suggest that relative infiltration measurements at shallow
depths may be useful to estimate potential infiltration during a short-duration high-intensity storm and could be used as
an input for post-fire erosion models.

$Abstract=Soils with high rock content are common in many US forests, and contain
large amounts of stored C. Accurate measurements of soil bulk density and
rock content are critical for calculating and assessing changes in both C
and nutrient pool size, but bulk density sampling methods have limitations
and sources of variability. Therefore, we evaluated the use of small-diameter
soil cores (SD), irregular soil volume excavation (IR), and a nuclear density
gauge (ND) to measure bulk density and rock content, and estimate C and
N pools in three 10-cm increments to a 30-cm depth in a glacial till soil in
northern Wisconsin. Total and fine bulk densities were lower when measured
with SD cores than with larger soil volume IR and ND methods. No differences
in C pools among bulk density sampling methods were found in the
10-cm increments, but when combined to 30 cm, the C pool estimate with IR
(81.6 Mg ha�1) was significantly higher than those of ND (75.3 Mg ha�1) and
SD (73.4 Mg ha�1). No significant differences in N pools were detected in the
10-cm increments, but the 0- to 30-cm N pool estimates by IR (5.65 Mg ha�1)
and ND (5 Mg ha�1) were higher than that of SD (4.22 Mg ha�1). Surface
rocks could lower soil C and N pools by 20% or more. Overall, the bulk density
method had little effect on soil C and N pool estimates in the surface 20
cm of this soil but did when sampled to 30 cm soil depth.

$Abstract=Post-wildfire soil erosion can be caused by water or aeolian processes, yet most erosion research has
focused on predominantly water-driven erosion. This study investigates the effectiveness of three agricultural
mulches, with and without a tackifier, on aeolian sediment transport processes. A wind tunnel
was used to simulate post-wildfire wind erosion at three wind speeds (6, 11 and 18 m s1). Shallow trays
containing soil collected after a wildfire were treated with chopped rice, wheat or chopped wheat mulch;
mulch treatments were also compounded with liquid treatments, tackifier to water ratios of 1:6, 1:3 and
water. The mulch treatments were generally easily moved at all wind speeds with cover reductions
greater than 90% at the highest wind speed. As expected, sediment loss was greatest for the bare soil
treatment, ranging from 6.5 g m2 at the lowest wind speed which increases to 6258 g m2 at the highest
wind speed. Adding wheat or chopped wheat mulch significantly reduced sediment loss by an order or
magnitude (698 and 298 g m2, respectively) at the highest wind speed. Adding chopped rice straw
reduced sediment loss by a half to 3573 g m2 at the highest wind speed, but the effect was not significant
due to mobilization of the mulch. The most effective sediment loss mitigation was achieved with
liquid tackifier treatments when applied to bare soil and when compounded with various mulch treatments,
particularly at the highest wind speed. These results may aid management decisions when mitigating
aeolian sediment transport after wildfires.

$Abstract=We collected field and remotely sensed data spanning 10 years after three 2003 Montana wildfires to monitor
ecological change across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis was used to
create post-fire maps of: char, soil, green (GV) and non-photosynthetic (NPV) vegetation from high-resolution 2003
hyperspectral (HS) and 2007 QuickBird (QB) imagery, and from Landsat 5 and 8 imagery collected on anniversary dates in
2002, 2003 (post fire), 2004, 2007 and 2013. Initial estimates of char and NPV from the HS images were significantly
correlated with their ground-measured counterparts (r � 0.60 (P � 0.03) and 0.68 (P � 0.01) respectively), whereas HS
GV and Landsat GV were correlated with canopy GV (r � 0.75 and 0.70 (P � 0.003) respectively). HS imagery had
stronger direct correlations with all classes of fine-scale ground data than Landsat and also had stronger predictive
correlations with 10-year canopy data (r�0.65 (P�0.02) to 0.84 (P�0.0003)). There was less than 5% understorey GV
cover on the sites initially, but by 2013, it had increased to nearly 60% regardless of initial condition. The data suggest it
took twice as long for understorey GV and NPV to replace char and soil as primary ground cover components on the highburn-
severity sites compared with other sites.

$Abstract=Post-wildfire flooding and erosion can threaten lives, property and natural resources. Increased peak flows and sediment delivery due to the loss of surface vegetation cover and fire-induced changes in soil properties are of great concern to public safety. Burn severity maps derived from remote sensing data reflect fire-induced changes in vegetative cover and soil properties. Slope, soils, land cover and climate are also important factors that require consideration. Many modelling tools and datasets have been developed to assist remediation teams, but process-based and spatially explicit models are currently underutilised compared with simpler, lumped models because they are difficult to set up and require properly formatted spatial inputs. To facilitate the use of models in conjunction with remote sensing observations, we developed an online spatial database that rapidly generates properly formatted modelling datasets modified by usersupplied soil burn severity maps. Although assembling spatial model inputs can be both challenging and time-consuming, the methods we developed to rapidly update these inputs in response to a natural disaster are both simple and repeatable. Automating the creation of model inputs facilitates the wider use of more accurate, process-based models for spatially explicit predictions of post-fire erosion and runoff.

$Abstract=Following wildfires, forest managers often consider salvage logging burned trees to recover monetary
value of timber, reduce fuel loads, or to meet other objectives. Relatively little is known about the cumulative
hydrologic effects of wildfire and subsequent timber harvest using logging equipment. We used
controlled rill experiments in logged and unlogged (control) forests burned at high severity in northern
Montana, eastern Washington, and southern British Columbia to quantify rill overland flow and sediment
production rates (fluxes) after ground-based salvage logging. We tested different types of logging
equipment�feller-bunchers, tracked and wheeled skidders, and wheeled forwarders�as well as traffic
levels and the addition of slash to skid trails as a best management practice. Rill experiments were done
at each location in the first year after the fire and repeated in subsequent years. Logging was completed in
the first or second post-fire year. We found that ground-based logging using heavy equipment compacted
soil, reduced soil water repellency, and reduced vegetation cover. Vegetation recovery rates were slower
in most logged areas than the controls. Runoff rates were higher in the skidder and forwarder plots than
their respective controls in the Montana and Washington sites in the year that logging occurred, and the
difference in runoff between the skidder and control plots at the British Columbia site was nearly significant
(p = 0.089). Most of the significant increases in runoff in the logged plots persisted for subsequent
years. The type of skidder, the addition of slash, and the amount of forwarder traffic did not significantly
affect the runoff rates. Across the three sites, rill sediment fluxes were 5�1900% greater in logged plots
than the controls in the year of logging, and the increases were significant for all logging treatments
except the low use forwarder trails. There was no difference in the first-year sediment fluxes between
the feller-buncher and tracked skidder plots, but the feller-buncher fluxes were lower than the values
from the wheeled skidder plots. Manually adding slash after logging did not affect sediment flux rates.
There were no significant changes in the control sediment fluxes over time, and none of the logging
equipment impacted plots produced greater sediment fluxes than the controls in the second or third year
after logging. Our results indicate that salvage logging increases the risk of sedimentation regardless
of equipment type and amount of traffic, and that specific best management practices are needed to
mitigate the hydrologic impacts of post-fire salvage logging.

$Abstract=The purpose of this paper is to recommend a framework and methodology for incorporating hydrologic data and
ecohydrologic relationships in Ecological Site Descriptions (ESDs) and thereby enhance the utility of ESDs for
assessing rangelands and guiding resilience-based management strategies. Resilience-based strategies assess
and manage ecological state dynamics that affect state vulnerability and, therefore, provide opportunities to
adapt management. Many rangelands are spatially heterogeneous or sparsely vegetated where the vegetation
structure strongly influences infiltration and soil retention. Infiltration and soil retention further influence soil
water recharge, nutrient availability, and overall plant productivity. These key ecohydrologic relationships
govern the ecologic resilience of the various states and community phases on many rangeland ecological sites
(ESs) and are strongly affected by management practices, land use, and disturbances. However, ecohydrologic
data and relationships are often missing in ESDs and state-and-transition models (STMs). To address this void,
we used literature to determine the data required for inclusion of key ecohydrologic feedbacks into ESDs,
developed a framework and methodology for data integration within the current ESD structure, and applied the
framework to a select ES for demonstrative purposes. We also evaluated the utility of the Rangeland Hydrology
and Erosion Model (RHEM) for assessment and enhancement of ESDs based in part on hydrologic function. We
present the framework as a broadly applicable methodology for integrating ecohydrologic relationships and
feedbacks into ESDs and resilience-based management strategies. Our proposed framework increases the utility
of ESDs to assess rangelands, target conservation and restoration practices, and predict ecosystem responses to
management. The integration of RHEM technology and our suggested framework on ecohydrologic relations
expands the ecological foundation of the overall ESD concept for rangeland management and is well aligned
with resilience-based, adaptive management of US rangelands. The proposed enhancement of ESDs will improve
communication between private land owners and resource managers and researchers across multiple disciplines
in the field of rangeland management.

$Abstract=Hydrologic response to rainfall on fragmented or burnt hillslopes is strongly influenced by the ensuing
connectivity of runoff and erosion processes. Yet cross-scale process connectivity is seldom evaluated in field studies
owing to scale limitations in experimental design. This study quantified surface susceptibility and hydrologic response
across point to hillslope scales at two degraded unburnt and burnt woodland sites using rainfall simulation and hydrologic
modelling. High runoff (31�47 mm) and erosion (154�1893 g m 2) measured at the patch scale (13 m2) were associated
with accumulation of fine-scale (0.5-m2) splash-sheet runoff and sediment and concentrated flow formation through
contiguous bare zones (64�85% bare ground). Burning increased the continuity of runoff and sediment availability and
yield. Cumulative runoff was consistent across plot scales whereas erosion increased with increasing plot area due to
enhanced sediment detachment and transport. Modelled hillslope-scale runoff and erosion reflected measured patch-scale
trends and the connectivity of processes and sediment availability. The cross-scale experiments and model predictions
indicate the magnitude of hillslope response is governed by rainfall input and connectivity of surface susceptibility,
sediment availability, and runoff and erosion processes. The results demonstrate the importance in considering cross-scale
structural and functional connectivity when forecasting hydrologic and erosion responses to disturbances.

$Abstract=Advances in research into wildfire impacts on runoff and erosion have demonstrated increasing complexity of
controlling factors and responses, which, combined with changing fire frequency, present challenges for modellers. We
convened a conference attended by experts and practitioners in post-wildfire impacts, meteorology and related research,
including modelling, to focus on priority research issues. The aim was to improve our understanding of controls and
responses and the predictive capabilities of models. This conference led to the eight selected papers in this special issue.
They address aspects of the distinctiveness in the controls and responses among wildfire regions, spatiotemporal rainfall
variability, infiltration, runoff connectivity, debris flow formation and modelling applications. Here we summarise key
findings from these papers and evaluate their contribution to improving understanding and prediction of post-wildfire
runoff and erosion under changes in climate, human intervention and population pressure on wildfire-prone areas.

$Abstract=Post-fire increases of runoff and erosion often occur and land managers need tools to be able to project the
increased risk. The Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model as
the underlying processor. ERMiT predicts the probability of a given amount of hillslope sediment delivery from a single
rainfall or snowmelt event on unburned, burned and recovering forest, range and chaparral hillslopes and the effectiveness
of selected mitigation treatments. Eight published field study sites were used to compare ERMiT predictions with observed
sediment deliveries. Most sites experienced only a few rainfall events that produced runoff and sediment (1.3�9.2%)
except for a California site with a Mediterranean climate (45.6%). When sediment delivery occurred, pooled Spearman
rank correlations indicated significant correlations between the observed sediment delivery and those predicted by
ERMiT. Correlations were r�0.65 for the controls, r�0.59 for the log erosion barriers and r�0.27 (not significant) for
the mulch treatments. Half of the individual sites also had significant correlations, as did 6 of 7 compared post-fire years.
These model validation results suggest reasonable estimates of probabilistic post-fire hillslope sediment delivery when
compared with observations from eight field sites.

$Abstract=Increases in wildfire occurrence and severity under an altered climate can substantially impact terrestrial
ecosystems through enhancing runoff erosion. Improved prediction tools that provide high resolution
spatial information are necessary for location-specific soil conservation and watershed management.
However, quantifying the magnitude of soil erosion and its interactions with climate, hydrological processes,
and fire occurrences across a large region (>10,000 km2) is challenging because of the large computational
requirements needed to capture the fine-scale complexities of the land surface that govern
erosion. We apply the physically-based coupled Variable Capacity Infiltration�Water Erosion
Prediction Project (VIC�WEPP) model to study how wildfire occurrences can enhance soil erosion in a
future climate over a representative watershed in the northern Rocky Mountains � the Salmon River
Basin (SRB) in central Idaho. While the VIC model simulates hydrologic processes at larger scales, the
WEPP model simulates erosion at the hillslope scale by sampling representative hillslopes.
VIC�WEPP model results indicate that SRB streamflow will have an earlier shift in peak flow by one to
two months under future climate scenarios in response to a declining snowpack under warming temperatures.
The magnitude of peak flow increases with each higher severity fire scenario; and under the highest
fire severity, the peak flow is shifted even earlier, exacerbating the effects of climate change. Similarly,
sediment yield also increases with higher fire severities for both historical and future climates. Sediment
yield is more sensitive to fire occurrence than to climate change by one to two orders of magnitude,
which is not unexpected given that our fire scenarios were applied basin wide as worst case scenarios.
In reality, fires only occur over portions of the basin in any given year and subsequent years� vegetation
regrowth reduces erosion. However, the effects of climate change on sediment yield result in greater spatial
heterogeneities, primarily because of the spatial differences in precipitation projections, while fire
conditions were uniformly applied. The combined effects of climate change and a possible continuation
of increasing fire frequency and severity will compound excess sediment issues that already exist in this
region of the intermountain West.

$Abstract=The 2000 Valley Complex wildfire burned in steep montane forests with ash cap soils in western Montana, USA.
The effects of high soil burn severity on forest soil hydrologic function were examined using rainfall simulations
(100mmh-1 for 1 h) on 0.5-m2 plots. Infiltration rates, sediment yields and sediment concentrationswere compared
among three treatments: control (unburned and undisturbed); bare (unburnedwith all surface vegetation,
litter, and duff removed prior to each simulation); and burned. Rainfall simulationswere done immediately after
the fire and repeated in 2001, 2002, and 2005. Soil moisture, water repellency, and understory canopy and
ground cover were measured and related to infiltration rates and sediment yields. The unburned forest soil
was water repellent at the mineral surface. This surface repellency was no longer detected after it was burned
at high severity, but a post-fire water repellent soil layer was observed at 1�2 cm below the surface. The control
plots had high ground cover (90% overall), infiltration of 44�48 mm, and very low sediment concentrations
(median values of 0.1�0.6 g L-1) and sediment yields (6�54 gm-2) for all years despite changes in soil moisture
and strongwater repellency. The bare and control plots had similar water repellency values, but the interrill erosion
in the bare plots was high throughout the study (624�1277 g m-2). In the year of the fire, the burned sites
had high rates of soil water repellency (88%) and little ground cover (10%). This resulted in low infiltration rates
(30 mm), high sediment concentrations (median value 21 g L-1), and high sediment yields (1157 g m-2). By
2005, the fire-altered water repellency decreased in occurrence (48%) and severity, and the ground cover increased
(42%). This resulted in much greater infiltration (84 mm), lower sediment concentration (median
value 0.5 g L-1), and lower sediment yields (15 g m-2) on the burned plots. The importance of ground cover
for preventing interrill erosion was demonstrated by the very low sediment yields on the control plots as compared
to the bare and burned plots. The strength and occurrence of water repellency in both the unburned and
burned sites decreased as soil moisture increased; however, strong soil water repellency was detected at the
soil surface whenever unburned soils were dry. Fire-altered soil water repellency influenced the infiltration capacity
and increased runoff rates immediately after the fire; however, the loss of protective ground cover was
a more significant factor for the increased sediment concentrations and sediment yields.

$Abstract=As the size and extent of wildfires has increased in recent decades, so has the cost and extent of post-fire management,
including seeding and salvage logging. However, we know little about how burn severity, salvage
logging, and post-fire seeding interact to influence vegetation recovery longterm. We sampled understory plant
species richness, diversity, and canopy cover one to six years post fire (2006 to 2009, and 2011) on 72 permanent
plots selected in a stratified random sample to define post-fire vegetation response to burn severity,
post-fire seeding with native grasses, and salvage logging on the 2005 School Fire in eastern Washington.
Understory vegetation responded rapidly post fire due, in part, to ample low intensity rainfall events in the
first post-fire growing season. Vegetation was more diverse with greater plant species richness and diversity
(Shannon-Wiener index) in low and moderate burn severity plots in 2006 (species richness 18; diversity 2.3)
compared to high burn severity plots (species richness 10; diversity 1.8), with species richness on the high severity
plots reaching 19 in the sixth post-fire year, similar to the initial values on the low and moderate burn
severity plots. Plants that commonly resprout from rhizomes, bulbs, and other surviving belowground sources
were abundant post fire, while those establishing from off-site seed sources, including non-native species, were
present but not abundant. Plots seeded with native grass post fire and not salvage logged had the highest canopy
cover of graminoid species: more than 30 % six years after the fire (in 2011), with low forb (15 %) and shrub
(1 %) canopy cover and species richness. For comparison, high severity plots that were not seeded and not
salvage logged had 3 % graminoid cover, 14 % forb cover, and 26 % shrub cover. Plots that had been salvage
logged from one to three years after the fire produced less canopy cover of shrubs and forbs, but three
times more canopy cover of graminoids on the high burn severity plots by 2011. High severity plots that
were salvage logged and not seeded with native grasses had the lowest species richness, diversity, and cover.
Very few non-native species were found, regardless of salvage logging and seeding. Rapid post-fire growth
dominated by native plants of high diversity suggests that this forest�s vegetation and soils are highly resilient
to disturbance. Overall, burn severity and post-fire seeding with native grasses were more influential
than salvage logging on understory plant abundance one to six years after fire.

$Abstract=Practical application of black carbon (biochar) to improve forest soil may be limited because biochar is hydrophobic.
In a laboratory, we tested the water repellency of biochar application (mixed or surface applied) to two forest
soils of varying texture (a granitic coarse-textured Inceptisol and an ash cap fine-textured Andisol) at four different application
rates (0, 1, 5, and 10 Mg ha-1) and five soil moisture contents (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of saturation). To
address the impact of biochar on water infiltration into the soil, we measured soil water repellency using three methods
(tension infiltrometer, water drop penetration, and molarity of ethanol). Generally, all three infiltration methods gave
similar results. Compared to the unamended coarse-textured Inceptisol at 0% saturation (oven dry), biochar mixed into
the soil at the rate of 5 Mg ha-1 did not result in a significant change (p = 0.05) in infiltration rate. The fine-textured
Andisol soil at 0% saturation did not show a significant change in infiltration at the application rate of 1 Mg ha-1 when
biochar was mixed into the soil. Surface applications of biochar on both soil textures resulted in less water infiltration
than the mixing treatments. Our results suggest that biochar decreases infiltration rates less on coarse-textured forest
soils as compared to finer-textured soils, and 1 to 5 Mg ha-1 will likely not detrimentally alter water infiltration rates.

$Abstract=Post-fire salvage logging adds another set of environmental effects to recently burned areas, and previous
 studies have reported varying impacts on vegetation, soil disturbance, and sediment production with limited
 data on the underlying processes. Our objectives were to determine how: (1) ground-based post-fire
 logging affects surface cover, soil water repellency, soil compaction, and vegetative regrowth; (2) different
 types of logging disturbance affect sediment production at the plot and small catchment ("swale")
 scales; and (3) applying logging slash to skid trails affects soil properties, vegetative regrowth, and sediment
 production. Four study areas were established in severely burned forests in the interior western
 USA. We installed plots at two study areas to compare burned but unlogged controls against skid trails,
 feller-buncher trails, and skid trails with added slash. Salvage logged and control swales were established
 at each study area, but only one study area had simultaneous measurements on replicated swales. Data
 were collected for 0-2 years prior to logging and from 2-8 years after logging.
 <br><br>
 The skidder and feller-buncher plots generally had greater compaction, less soil water repellency, and
 slower vegetative regrowth than the controls. Sediment production from the skidder plots was 10-100
 times the value from the controls. The slightly less compacted feller-buncher plots produced only 10- 30%
 as much sediment as the skidder plots, but regrowth was similarly inhibited. The relative differences
 in sediment production between the disturbed plots and the controls tended to increase over time as the
 controls exhibited more rapid regrowth. Adding slash to skid trails increased total ground cover by 20-30%
 and reduced the sediment yields by 5-50 times compared to the untreated skidder plots.
 <br><br>
 The replicated logged swales at one study area generally had higher sediment production rates than
 their controls but the absolute values per unit area were much lower than from the skidder and fellerbuncher
 plots. Results from the swales at the other study areas indicated that logging did not increase
 runoff, peak flows, or sediment yields.
 <br><br>
 Vegetative regrowth and sediment production rates varied widely among the four study areas. This
 variation was largely due to differences in rainfall and soil properties, with the more productive sites having
 more rapid regrowth and thereby a more rapid reduction in sediment production. The susceptibility
 to surface runoff and erosion after high severity fires suggests that areas disturbed by ground-based
 salvage logging need additional mitigation practices.

$Abstract=Post-fire mulch and seeding treatments, often applied on steep, severely burned slopes immediately after large wildfires, are meant to reduce
the potential of erosion and establishment of invasive plants, especially non-native plants, that could threaten values at risk. However, the effects of
these treatments on native vegetation response post fire are little studied, especially beyond one to two years. We compared species richness, diversity,
and percent canopy cover of understory plants one, two, three, four, and six years after immediate post-fire application of wood strand mulch, agricultural
wheat straw mulch, hydromulch + seed with locally adapted native grasses, seed only with locally adapted native grasses with no mulch, and
untreated (no mulch or grass seeding) after the 2005 School Fire in Washington, USA. For wood strand mulch treatments, mean canopy cover of
grasses and forbs was low, varying from 3% to 20% in post-fire years two through six; whereas wheat straw mulch had the lowest mean cover of
grasses, &lt;1%, and the highest canopy cover of both forbs and shrubs, each &gt;29% in post-fire years two through six. Plots hydromulched and seeded
with grass, and those seeded with grass but not mulched, tended to have higher grass cover than other treatments and untreated plots over the six years. Species
richness and diversity was highest for the hydromulch + seed treatment.
Ten non-native species were found, but never with more than 2% canopy cover, each. Although the inference of our small-plot work is limited, our results
suggest that post-fire rehabilitation treatments apparently altered the abundance and diversity of native perennial understory plants for one to six years
post fire &ndash; effects that could persist for decades.

$Abstract=Measurement of particle-size distribution (PSD) of soil with large-sized particles (e.g., 25.4 mm diameter) requires a large sample and numerous particle-size analyses (PSAs).
 A new method is needed that would reduce time, effort, and cost for PSAs of the soil and aggregate material with large-sized particles.
 We evaluated a nested method for sampling and PSA by comparing it with the methods that follow the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) standard
 T88-00 and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standard D422-63.
 Using 33 forest road aggregate samples from the Clearwater National Forest in northern Idaho, the nested method required much less laboratory time and effort and resulted in similar PSA values,
 except for the 0.149 mm (No. 100) sieve, where the smallest particle-size fraction (PSF) values (1.30% and 1.39%) were observed.
 The nested method shows great potential for determining PSDs of the soil and aggregate material with large-sized particles and should be tested on other forest soils and road aggregates.
 The nested sampling and analysis method allows for the same number of samples to be collected but requires less laboratory time, making it more efficient and economical for testing the soil
 and aggregate material with large-sized particles such as forest road aggregate.

$Abstract=The convolution of an input with a response function has been widely used in hydrology as a means to solve various problems analytically.
 Due to the high computation demand in solving the functions using numerical integration, it is often advantageous to use the discrete convolution instead of the integration of the continuous functions.
 This approach greatly reduces the amount of the computational work; however, it increases the possibility for mass balance errors.
 In this study, we analyzed the characteristics of the kernel function for the Hayami convolution solution to the linear diffusion-wave channel routing with distributed lateral inflow.
 We propose two ways of selection of the discrete kernel function values: using the exact point values or using the center-averaged values.
 Through a hypothetical example and the applications to Asotin Creek, WA and the Clearwater River, ID, we showed that when the point kernel function values were used in the
 discrete Hayami convolution (DHC) solution, the mass balance error of channel routing is dependent on the number of time steps on the rising limb of the Hayami kernel function.
 The mass balance error is negligible when there are more than 1.8 time steps on the rising limb of the kernel function.
 The fewer time steps on the rising limb, the greater risk of high mass balance errors.
 When the average kernel function values are used for the DHC solution, however, the mass balance is always maintained, since the integration of the discrete kernel function is always unity.

$Abstract=Post-fire sediment yields can be up to three orders of magnitude greater than sediment yields in unburned
 forests. Much of the research on post-fire erosion rates has been at small scales (100m<sup>2</sup> or less), and post-fire sediment
 delivery rates across spatial scales have not been quantified in detail. We developed relationships for post-fire bedload
 sediment delivery rates for spatial scales up to 117 ha using sediment yield data from six published studies and two
 recently established study sites. Sediment yields and sediment delivery ratios (SDRs; sediment delivered at the catchment
 scale divided by the sediment delivered from a plot nested within the catchment) were related to site factors
 including rainfall characteristics, area, length, and ground cover. Unit-area sediment yields significantly decreased with
 increasing area in five of the six sites. The annual SDRs ranged from 0.0089 to 1.15 and these were more closely
 related to the ratio of the plot lengths than the ratio of plot areas. The developed statistical relationships will help
 quantify post-fire sediment delivery rates across spatial scales in the interior western United States and develop
 process-based scaling relationships.

$Abstract=Changes in the properties of an ash layer with time may affect the amount of post-fire runoff, particularly by
 the formation of ash surface crusts. The formation of depositional crusts by ash have been observed at the pore and plot
 scales, but the causes and temporal evolution of ash layers and associated crusts have not yet been thoroughly investigated.
 In the long term, ash crusting effects will decrease as the ash layer is removed by wind and water erosion, but in the short
 term ash crusting could contribute to the observed changes in post-fire runoff. This research addresses these topics by
 studying the evolution over time of highly combusted ash layers from two high-severity wildfires that occurred in Montana
 in 2011. More specifically, this research was designed to assess the potential for ash crusts to form and thereby contribute
 to the observed decreases in infiltration after forest fires. Results indicate that high-combustion ash can evolve due to postfire
 rainfall. Plots that exhibited a visible ash crust also displayed a significant decrease in effective porosity and hydraulic
 conductivity. These decreases in ash layer characteristics were attributed to raindrop compaction and ash hydration
 resulting in the formation of carbonate crystals, which decreased effective porosity and flow within the ash layer. During
 this same time period, inorganic carbon content more than doubled from 11 to 26% and bulk density significantly
 increased from 0.22 to 0.39&nbsp;g&nbsp;cm&nbsp;<sup>-3</sup> on crusted plots. Although raindrop impact increased the robustness of the ash crust,
 mineralogical transformations must occur to produce a hydrologically relevant ash crust. These results indicate that postfire
 rainfall is an important control on the properties of the ash layer after burning and on crust formation. The observed
 temporal changes indicate that the timing of ash sampling can alter the predictions as to whether the ash layer is effecting
 post-fire infiltration and runoff. Despite the reduction in infiltration capacity, the formation of post-fire ash crusts could
 prove beneficial to post-fire hazard mitigation by stabilising the ash layer, and reducing aeolian mixing and erosion.

 western US forest fires have been examined to identify decadal patterns in fire characteristics and the justifications and
 expenditures for the post-fire treatments. The main trends found were:
 (1) the area burned by wildfire increased over time and the rate of increase accelerated after 1990;
 (2) the proportions of burned area assessed as low, moderate and high burn severity likely have remained fairly constant over time, but the use of satellite imagery that began c. 2000 increased the resolution of burn severity assessments leading to an apparent decreased proportion of high burn severity during the 2000s;
 (3) treatment justifications reflected regional concerns (e.g. soil productivity in areas of timber harvest) and generally reflected increased human encroachment in the wildland&ndash;urban interface;
 (4) modifications to roads were the most frequently recommended post-fire treatment type;
 (5) seeding was the most frequently used land treatment, but declined in use over time;
 (6) use of post-fire agricultural straw mulch has steadily increased because of proven success; and
 (7) the greatest post-fire expenditures have been for land treatments applied over large areas to protect important resources (e.g. municipal water sources).

$Abstract=The recent increase in wildfire activity across the rangeland&ndash;xeric forest continuum in the western United
 States has landscape-scale consequences in terms of runoff and erosion. Concomitant cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i> L.)
 invasions, plant community transitions and a warming climate in recent decades along grassland&ndash;shrubland&ndash;woodland&ndash;xeric
 forest transitions have promoted frequent and large wildfires, and continuance of the trend appears likely if warming
 climate conditions prevail. These changes potentially increase overall hydrologic vulnerability by spatially and temporally
 increasing soil exposure to runoff and erosion processes. Plot and hillslope-scale studies demonstrate burning may
 increase event runoff or erosion by factors of 2&ndash;40 over small-plot scales and more than 100-fold over large-plot to
 hillslope scales. Reports of flooding and debris flow events from rangelands and xeric forests following burning show the
 potential risk to natural resources, property, infrastructure and human life. We present a conceptual model for evaluating
 post-fire hydrologic vulnerability and risk. We suggest that post-fire risk assessment of potential hydrologic hazards
 should adopt a probability-based approach that considers varying site susceptibility in conjunction with a range of
 potential storms and that determines the hydrologic response magnitudes likely to affect values-at-risk. Our review
 suggests that improved risk assessment requires better understanding in several key areas including quantification of
 interactions between varying storm intensities and measures of site susceptibility, the varying effects of soil water
 repellency, and the spatial scaling of post-fire hydrologic response across rangeland&ndash;xeric forest plant communities.

$Abstract=Four years post-wildfire, we measured soil and plant properties on hillslopes treated with two different mulches (agricultural wheat straw and wood strands)
 and a control (unmulched, but burned).
 Soil total N was about 40% higher and microbial respiration of a standard wood substrate was nearly twice as high in the mulched plots compared to the unmulched plots.
 Greater respiration was tied to increased substrate moisture underneath mulch compared to bare soil.
 Nitrate reductase activity of a common forb (<i>Arnica cordifolia</i>) was about 30% higher on the wood strand plots than either the wheat straw or the unmulched plots.
 Mulch applications after wildfire may enhance N availability by increasing soil moisture, promoting microbial N mineralization, or by increasing biological nitrogen fixation.
 Because inference is limited for this case study, we call for additional replicated experiments investigating effects of mulch treatments on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling
 with links to plant regeneration.

$Abstract=In cold regions, frozen soil has a significant influence on runoff and water erosion.
 In the U.S. Inland Pacific Northwest, major erosion events typically occur during winter as frozen soil thaws and exhibits low cohesion.
 Previous applications of the WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) model to a continuous bare tilled fallow (CBF) runoff plot at the Palouse Conservation Field Station (PCFS) in southeastern Washington State showed that WEPP reproduced the occurrence of the large erosion events, but the amount of sediment yield was either under- or overestimated.
 The inability of WEPP to reproduce the magnitude of field-observed erosion events at the PCFS suggests the need for an examination of the dynamic changes in soil erosion properties and for improving the representation of such dynamics.
 The objective of this study was to evaluate the seasonal changes of rill erosion parameters for two CBF runoff plots at the PCFS.
 Fieldobserved runoff and erosion events during 1984-1990 were used to estimate WEPP hydraulic and erosion parameters, including soil effective hydraulic conductivity, critical shear stress (Tc), and rill erodibility (Kr).
 The parameters for each event were best-fitted using WEPP single-event simulations to reproduce the observed runoff and sediment yield on both plots.
 The results suggest that the adjustment factors for Tc and Kr of frozen and thawing soils in the WEPP model could be modified to better describe the changes of these parameters in winter.

$Abstract=The assessment of water yield from hillslopes into streams is critical in managing water supply and aquatic habitat.
 Streamflow is typically composed of surface runoff, subsurface lateral flow, and groundwater baseflow; baseflow sustains the stream during the dry season.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model simulates surface runoff, subsurface lateral flow, soil water, and deep percolation.
 However, to adequately simulate hydrologic conditions with significant quantities of groundwater flow into streams, a baseflow component for WEPP is needed.
 The objectives of this study were
 (1) to simulate streamflow in the Priest River Experimental Forest in the U.S. Pacific Northwest using the WEPP model and a baseflow routine, and
 (2) to compare the performance of the WEPP model with and without including the baseflow using observed streamflow data.
 The baseflow was determined using a linear reservoir model. The WEPP-simulated and observed streamflows were in reasonable agreement when baseflow was considered, with an overall Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.67 and deviation of runoff volume (Dv) of 7%.
 In contrast, the WEPP simulations without including baseflow resulted in an overall NSE of 0.57 and Dv of 47%.
 On average, the simulated baseflow accounted for 43% of the streamflow and 12% of precipitation annually.
 Integration of WEPP with a baseflow routine improved the model's applicability to watersheds where groundwater contributes to streamflow.

$Abstract=At the hillslope profile and/or field scale, a simple Windows graphical user interface (GUI) is available to easily specify the slope, soil, and management inputs for application of the USDA Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model.
 Likewise, basic small watershed configurations of a few hillslopes and channels can be created and simulated with this GUI.
 However, as the catchment size increases, the complexity of developing and organizing all WEPP model inputs greatly increases due to the multitude of potential variations in topography, soils, and land management practices.
 For these types of situations, numerical approaches and special user interfaces have been developed to allow for easier WEPP model setup, utilizing either publicly available or user-specific geospatial information, e.g., digital elevation models (DEMs), geographic information system (GIS) soil data layers, and GIS land use/land cover data layers.
 We utilize the Topographic Parameterization (TOPAZ) digital landscape analysis tool for channel, watershed, and subcatchment delineation and to derive slope inputs for each of the subcatchment hillslope profiles and channels.
 A user has the option of specifying a single soil and land management for each subcatchment or utilizing the information in soils and land use/land cover GIS data layers to automatically assign those values for each grid cell.
 Once WEPP model runs are completed, the output data are analyzed, results interpreted, and maps of spatial soil loss and sediment yields are generated and visualized in a GIS.
 These procedures have been used within a number of GIS platforms including GeoWEPP, an ArcView/ArcGIS extension that was the first geospatial interface to be developed in 2001.
 GeoWEPP allows experienced GIS users the ability to import and utilize their own detailed DEM, soil, and/or land use/land cover information or to access publicly available spatial datasets.
 A web-based GIS system that used MapServer web GIS software for handling and displaying the spatial data and model results was initially released in 2004.
 Most recently, Google Maps and OpenLayers technologies have been integrated into the web WEPP GIS software to provide significant enhancements.
 This article discusses in detail the logic and procedures for developing the WEPP model inputs, the various WEPP GIS interfaces, and provides example real-world geospatial WEPP applications.
 Further work is ongoing in order to expand these tools to allow users to customize their own inputs via the internet and to link the desktop GeoWEPP with the web-based GIS system.

$Abstract=In the northwestern U.S., the greatest amounts of forest erosion usually follow infrequent wildfires.
 Sediment from these fires is gradually routed through the stream system.
 The forest road network is usually the second greatest source of sediment, generating sediment annually.
 Erosion rates associated with timber harvest, biomass removal, and prescribed fire are generally minimal with current management practices.
 Landslides and debris flows can contribute significant amounts of sediment during infrequent wet years or following wildfire.
 A relatively new source of sediment in forested watersheds is recreation, particularly all-terrain vehicle trails.
 Stream channels store and route sediment; in the absence of channel disturbance, they tend to reach an equilibrium condition in which sediment entering a given reach is balanced by sediment carried downstream.
 At times, sediment from roads, wildfire, or landslides may accumulate in channels until higher flow rates, often associated with rainfall on melting snow, flush it downstream.
 Prediction tools are needed to aid forest managers in estimating the impacts of soil erosion on upland productivity and the risks of sediment delivery to downstream habitats and water users.
 Tools have been developed to aid in estimating long-term, low-level erosion in undisturbed forests and delivery of sediment from roads, and tools for estimating short-term, event-driven sediment from disturbed forests have also been developed.
 Online and GIS interfaces were developed using the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, including soil, vegetation, and climate databases.
 The online interfaces were developed to allow users to more easily predict soil erosion and sediment delivery for a wide range of climatic and forest conditions, including roads, fires, and timber harvest.
 There have been ongoing efforts to improve the online watershed interface to better model channel processes, road networks, and spatial variability associated with wildfire and weather.

$Abstract=A new version of the online Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) GIS interface has been developed to assist in evaluating sediment sources associated with forests and forest management within the Great Lakes basin.
 WEPP watershed structure and topographical inputs for each watershed element are generated from the USGS 30&nbsp;m National Elevation Dataset (NED), soil inputs are automatically retrieved
 from the USDA-NRCS SSURGO database, and land use and management inputs are selected from the WEPP database based on the USGS National Land Cover Database 2001 (NLCD2001).
 Additionally, ground cover and soil properties of the WEPP management and soil input files can be customized to represent site-specific conditions.
 Daily climate inputs are generated from long-term climate parameters using CLIGEN, a stochastic climate generator embedded in the online interface.
 Alternatively, a registered user can upload and use observed daily climate data for online WEPP simulation.
 Long-term observational data, including runoff and water chemistry, from two mature forest watersheds of the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia were used to assess the online WEPP GIS interface.
 Online WEPP simulations were carried out using both observed and CLIGEN-generated climate inputs, and model performance was examined by comparing simulated and observed runoff and simulated and estimated (from measured water chemistry data) sediment yield.
 The online WEPP reasonably simulated average annual runoff and the annual maximum runoff series for both watersheds, but overpredicted sediment yield for the annual average and annual maximums.
 The online WEPP simulation results accurately reflected the differences between the two watersheds in their hydrological characteristics.
 The online WEPP GIS interface is a user-friendly, web-based computer package that can be used by scientists, researchers, and practitioners as a cost-effective simulation tool for watershed management.

 Culverts used on these roads were historically designed to convey water under the road with little attention given to passage of aquatic organisms.
 In the past decade or so, driven largely by the Endangered Species Act listing of various salmonids in the Pacific Northwest, managers have designed and installed culverts to accommodate passage of aquatic species.
 Many existing culverts designed under the old criteria are impediments to passage and are replaced with culverts or bridges designed to accommodate aquatic species passage. Managers weigh the short-term negative impacts of sediment in the stream during culvert replacement against the positive long-term impacts of improved passage when considering which culverts to replace.

$Abstract=Wildland fires often cause extreme changes in the landscape that drastically influence surface runoff
 and soil erosion, which can impact forest resources, aquatic habitats, water supplies, public safety, and
 forest access infrastructure such as forest roads. Little information is available on the effectiveness of
 various post-fire road treatments, thus this study was designed to evaluate common treatments implemented
 after fire. The 2006 Tripod Complex, 2007 Cascade Complex, and the 2008 Klamath Theater
 Complex Fires were selected because of their large size and extensive use of road treatments. Two of
 the three locations had below average precipitation and all three had precipitation that did not achieve
 the post-fire road treatment design storms. With this amount of precipitation testing, all of the treatments
 we monitored met the design objectives. All three of the locations had large soil loss in the first year
 after the fire followed by a quick recovery of ground cover to 40 to 50 percent at the end of year one.
 Soil loss from roadside hydromulch was not statistically significant from control (no treatment) on the
 Tripod Complex sites. Soil loss at the Cascade Complex sites was a statistically significant difference
 on the straw mulch compared to the control (no treatment), but there were no different pairwise differences
 among straw mulch, Polyacrylamide (PAM), and Woodstraw<sup>TM</sup>. This suggests that the amount
 of cover is more important than the type of cover. Three studies and 5 years after beginning the studies,
 we think the best approach to assessing the effectiveness of post-fire BAER road treatments is to
 gain a limited knowledge of many sites along a road system rather than a detailed knowledge of a few sites.

$Abstract=A considerable investment in post-fire research over the past decade has improved our understanding of
 wildfire effects on soil, hydrology, erosion and erosion-mitigation treatment effectiveness. Using this new knowledge, we
 have developed several tools to assist land managers with post-wildfire assessment and treatment decisions, such as
 prediction models, research syntheses, equipment and methods for field measurements, reference catalogues and
 databases of past-practice, and spreadsheets for calculating resource valuation and cost.benefit analysis. These tools
 provide relevant science to post-fire assessment teams and land managers in formats that often can be directly entered into
 assessment and treatment decision-making protocols. Providing public access to these tools through the internet not only
 has increased their dissemination, but also has allowed them to be updated and improved as new knowledge and
 technology become available. The use of these science-based tools has facilitated a broader application of current
 knowledge to post-fire management in the United States and in other fire-prone areas around the world.

$Abstract=Wind erosion and aeolian transport processes are under studied compared to rainfall-induced erosion
 and sediment transport on burned landscapes. Post-fire wind erosion studies have predominantly
 focused on near-surface sediment transport and associated impacts such as on-site soil loss and site fertility.
 Downwind impacts, including air quality degradation and deposition of dust or contaminants, are
 also likely post-fire effects; however, quantitative field measurements of post-fire dust emissions are
 needed for assessment of these downwind risks. A wind erosion monitoring system was installed immediately
 following a desert sagebrush and grass wildfire in southeastern Idaho, USA to measure wind erosion
 from the burned landscape. This paper presents measurements of horizontal sediment flux and PM<sub>10</sub>
 vertical flux from the burned area. We determined threshold wind speeds and corresponding threshold
 friction velocities to be 6.0 and 0.20 m s <sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for the 4 months immediately following the fire
 and 10 and 0.55 m s <sup>-1</sup> for the following spring months. Several major wind erosion events were measured
 in the months following the July 2010 Jefferson Fire. The largest wind erosion event occurred in
 early September 2010 and produced 1495 kg m <sup>-1</sup> of horizontal sediment transport within the first 2 m
 above the soil surface, had a maximum PM<sub>10</sub> vertical flux of 100 mg m <sup>-2</sup> s <sup>-1</sup>, and generated a large dust
 plume that was visible in satellite imagery. The peak PM<sub>10</sub> concentration measured on-site at a height of
 2 m in the downwind portion of the burned area was 690 mg m <sup>-3</sup>. Our results indicate that wildfire can
 convert a relatively stable landscape into one that is a major dust source.

$Abstract=Guidelines for the production and aerial application of wood shred mulch as a post-fire
 hillslope treatment were developed from laboratory and field studies, several field operations,
 and the evaluations of professionals involved in those operations. At two early trial sites,
 the wood shred mulch was produced off-site and transported to the area of use.
 At the 2010 Schultz Fire in Arizona, the wood mulches were produced on-site from burned hazard trees
 that were felled and skidded to a processing area where the logs were shredded by a horizontal grinder and piled.
 The subsequent aerial applications of the wood shreds were staged from the same landings where they were produced.
 At the 2010 Fourmile Canyon, 2012 High Park, and 2012 Waldo Canyon Fires in Colorado, wood shreds were produced
 from various combinations of on- and off-site burned and green trees that were generally shredded near the harvest
 or storage site.
 The wood shreds were transported by chip trucks to aerial application staging areas.
 The most challenging aspect of wood shred production was adjusting the grinder screens and through-put speed to
 maximize the proportion of shreds that were 2 to 8 inches (50 to 200 mm) in length.
 The same equipment and techniques used for aerial mulching with agricultural straw worked, with some adjustments
 in flight altitude and speed, for wood shreds.
 The Heli-Claw, an experimental device designed to replace the cargo net in aerial mulching, was tested and used to
 apply 80 percent of the wood shred mulch at the Beal Mountain mine reclamation site.
 Because wood shreds are four to six times heavier than agricultural straw, wood shred mulch took longer to apply
 than agricultural straw for the same area (25 to 35 ac [10 to 14 ha] per day for wood shreds; approximately 200 ac
 [81 ha] per day for straw).
 The additional flight time makes mulching with wood shreds cost three to four times more than with agricultural straw
 ($1700 to $2200 per ac [$4200 to $5500 per ha] for wood shreds; $500 to $700 per acre [$1200 to 1700 per ha] for straw).
 However, the advantages of wood shreds&mdash;on- or near-site availability, greater stability in high winds and on
 steep slopes, and lack of unwanted plant seeds from off-site&mdash;make wood shred mulch useful in areas where
 agricultural straw mulch may not be desirable.

$Publisher=Elsevier Earth-Sciene Reviews
$Abstract=Research into post-wildfire effects began in the United States more than 70 years ago and only later extended to other parts of the world. Post-wildfire responses are typically transient, episodic, variable in space and time, dependent on thresholds, and involve multiple processes measured by different methods. These characteristics
 tend to hinder research progress, but the large empirical knowledge base amassed in different regions of the
 world suggests that it should now be possible to synthesize the data and make a substantial improvement in
 the understanding of post-wildfire runoff and erosion response. Thus, it is important to identify and prioritize
 the research issues related to post-wildfire runoff and erosion. Priority research issues are the need to: (1) organize
 and synthesize similarities and differences in post-wildfire responses between different fire-prone regions
 of theworld in order to determine common patterns and generalities that can explain cause and effect relations;
 (2) identify and quantify functional relations between metrics of fire effects and soil hydraulic properties that
 will better represent the dynamic and transient conditions after a wildfire; (3) determine the interaction
 between burned landscapes and temporally and spatially variable meso-scale precipitation, which is often the
 primary driver of post-wildfire runoff and erosion responses; (4) determine functional relations between precipitation,
 basinmorphology, runoff connectivity, contributing area, surface roughness, depression storage, and soil
 characteristics required to predict the timing, magnitudes, and duration of floods and debris flows fromungaged
 burned basins; and (5) develop standard measurement methods that will ensure the collection of uniform and
 comparable runoff and erosion data. Resolution of these issues will help to improve conceptual and computer
 models of post-wildfire runoff and erosion processes.

$Abstract=After the 2009 Terrace Mountain fire near Kelowna, BC, Canada, wood shred and agricultural straw mulch effects
 on post-fire runoff and sediment yields were compared using three experimental techniques: rainfall
 simulations on 1-m<sup>2</sup> plots, concentrated flow (rill) simulations on 9-m long plots, and sediment yields from
 natural rainfall on 30-m<sup>2</sup> plots. All experimental plots were located on and along a planar hillslope burned
 at high severity. Experiments were conducted once a year for three consecutive years beginning in Sep
 2009, except for the rainfall simulations which only were conducted the first two years. Although results varied
 by experiment and time since fire, both agricultural straw and wood shred mulch treatments performed
 similarly for reducing runoff and sediment; thus were combined into a single "treated" class for analyses.
 The mulch treatments were effective in reducing sediment yields as compared to the controls in all three experiments
 in 2009. In the rill simulation experiment, the mulch treatments significantly reduced overland
 flow velocity and increased the proportion of overland flow that infiltrated the soil before reaching the plot
 outlet. The elapsed time since the fire, which was strongly related to the increase in vegetative ground
 cover, was a significant factor for predicting sediment yields in the statistical models. Favorable spring rainfall
 in 2010 and 2011 supported rapid regrowth of vegetation, which recovered similarly on all plots regardless of
 treatment. The runoff and sediment yields on the treated plots were similar to those measured on the control
 plots a year later; we concluded that the mulch was, in effect, a surrogate for a year of recovery. Given that agricultural
 straw mulch is an established and effective post-fire hillslope treatment, it was important to find
 that wood shred mulch was similarly effective in reducing post-fire runoff and sediment yields. Thus, the
 choice of agricultural straw or wood shreds for a post-fire mulch treatment may be based on the performance
 characteristics (longevity, potential to carry invasive species seeds, cost, etc.) that best fit the needs of the site.

$Abstract=Agricultural straw, hydromulch, and wood shred or wood strand mulches increasingly are being used as
 post-fire hillslope treatments, but the differences in effectiveness among these mulch treatments are not
 fully understood. Following the 2002 Hayman fire in central Colorado and the 2003 Cedar fire in southern
 California, matched catchments were monitored for five to seven post-fire years to determine the effectiveness
 of wheat straw mulch (Hayman fire only) and hydromulch in reducing post-fire runoff, peak flow rates,
 and sediment yields from natural rainfall. Measured runoff and sediment yields were caused by short duration
 high intensity summer storms at the Hayman fire and long duration winter rains at the Cedar fire.
 The wheat straw mulch treatment significantly reduced peak flow rates and sediment yields at the Hayman
 fire. The annual peak flow rates in the first two post-fire years in the straw mulch catchment were 
 4.5 and 3.9&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>-2</sup> (respectively) as compared to 
 4.3 and 7.1&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;s<sup>-1</sup>&nbsp;km<sup>-2</sup> (respectively) in the control.
 In post-fire years one and two, the maximum event sediment yields in the straw mulch catchment were 
 7.2 and 10&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, which were less than half of the maximum event sediment yields in the control
 catchment (19 and 24&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup>, respectively). The straw mulch catchment had no detectable runoff or
 sediment yield after the second post-fire year, but the control catchment continued to have measurable runoff
 and sediment yields through the seventh post-fire year. The straw mulch treatment effect in runoff reduction
 was not significant in the statistical model. Total ground cover was 80% immediately after the application
 of straw mulch, and decreased to 10% by the end of first post-fire year, yet total ground cover values remained
 high as litter and vegetation, including invasive cheatgrass, increased.
 <br><br>
 The hydromulch cover at both fires declined rapidly and provided less than 10% of the ground cover within
 2.5&nbsp;months after application at which point the catchment was presumed to be untreated. Due to differences
 in precipitation, the three catchments at the Cedar fire had significantly different hydrologic responses during
 the presumed untreated portion of the study, which precluded evaluation of treatment effectiveness during
 the short treated period. The peak flow responses from the hydromulch and control catchments at the
 Hayman fire were also different during the presumed untreated period and were not tested. Although the
 runoff and sediment yields did not differ during the presumed untreated period and were tested for treatment
 effects, the Hayman hydromulch treatment did not significantly affect either response during the
 first post-fire year&nbsp;the presumed treated period.
 <br><br>
 Unit-area sediment yields from the catchments were similar to those measured on hillslope plots at both the
 Hayman and Cedar fires in the first post-fire years, but in later years the sediment yields from the catchments
 were at least double the sediment yields measured on hillslope plots. The longer periods of greater erosion
 rates in the catchments likely reflect the addition of channel erosion processes and a difference in hydrologic
 connectivity at the catchment scale.

$Abstract=Mulch treatments often are used to mitigate post-fire increases in runoff and erosion rates but the comparative
  effectiveness of various mulches is not well established. The ability of mulch treatments to reduce sediment
  yields from natural rainfall and resulting overland flow was measured using hillslope plots on areas burned at
  high severity following four wildfires in the western United States. Wheat straw mulch, wood strand mulch,
  and hydromulch were evaluated along with untreated control plots on multiple fires for 4 to 7 years after burning.
  Needle cast from fire-killed conifer trees was evaluated in an area of moderate burn severity at one fire, and
  seeding with genetically native seed was tested, with and without hydromulch, at another fire. Rainfall, ground
  cover, and soil water repellency were measured in each treatment site at all 4 fires.Mean sediment yields on the
  control plots ranged from 0.3 to 7.5&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> in the first post-fire year, from 0.03 to 0.6&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> in the second,
  and from 0 to 0.4&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> in the third and fourth post-fire years. Assuming a linear fit between sediment yield
  and rainfall intensity, stormswith equivalent rainfall intensities produced nearly an order ofmagnitude less sediment
  on the control plots in the second post-fire year as compared to the first post-fire year. Large storms (at
  least a 2-year return period, 10-min maximum rainfall intensity) produced sediment on all fires in all years
  where they occurred; however, sediment yields produced by large storms that occurred in the first post-fire
  year were larger than the sediment yields from equivalent storms that occurred in later years at the same fire.
  Sediment yields decreased as ground cover increased and all the mulch treatments increased total ground
  cover to more than 60% immediately after application. However, the longevity of the mulches varied, so
  that the contribution of the treatment mulch to total ground cover varied by mulch type over time. The
  wood strand mulch was the most long-lived of the mulch treatments and was observed in ground cover
  assessments throughout the study period (4 and 7&nbsp;years) at two fires. The wheat straw mulch decreased
  nearly twice as fast as the wood strand mulch, and no hydromulch was detected after the first post-fire
  year on either fire where it was tested.
  <br><br>
  Mulch treatment effectiveness varied when data were analyzed separately for each fire.Wood strand mulch reduced
  sediment yields at both fireswhere itwas tested, wheat strawmulch reduced sediment yields at 2 of the 4&nbsp;fires
  where it was applied, and the hydromulch tested at 2&nbsp;fires did not reduce sediment yields on either.When
  data were normalized and analyzed by treatment across all fires, wood strandmulch reduced sediment yields for
  the first four post-fire years, butwheat strawmulch and hydromulch did not significantly reduce sediment yields
  in any post-fire year. The greater variability in the combined data resulted in fewer statistically significant treatment
  effects being observed as compared to the individual fire analyses.We believe the fire-specific results provide
  the more accurate representation of potential post-fire mulch treatment effectiveness.

$Abstract=This study tested the erosion mitigation effectiveness of agricultural straw and two
 wood-based mulches for four years on decommissioned forest roads. Plots were installed on
 the loosely consolidated, bare soil to measure sediment production, mulch cover, and plant
 regrowth. The experimental design was a repeated measures, randomized block on two soil
 types common in the northern Rocky Mountain area. The control produced the most sediment,
 while wood strands produced the least during the critical first winter following road
 decommissioning. Following the first year, there was no statistically significant difference in
 sediment production among the mulches or control. One year after the three mulches were
 applied, there was no statistical difference among mulch cover. Further, none of the mulches
 inhibited plant regrowth. The conservation implications of these research findings demonstrated
 that wood-based alternatives to agricultural straw were equally effective in reducing
 sediment production from originally bare, unvegetated soil strips resulting from forest road
 decommissioning. The amount of effective ground cover provided by mulch, plants, and litter
 appeared to be more important than the type of mulch.

$Abstract=A considerable investment in post-fire research over the past decade has improved our understanding of
 wildfire effects on soil, hydrology, erosion and erosion-mitigation treatment effectiveness. Using this new knowledge, we
 have developed several tools to assist land managers with post-wildfire assessment and treatment decisions, such as
 prediction models, research syntheses, equipment and methods for field measurements, reference catalogues and
 databases of past-practice, and spreadsheets for calculating resource valuation and cost.benefit analysis. These tools
 provide relevant science to post-fire assessment teams and land managers in formats that often can be directly entered into assessment and treatment decision-making protocols. Providing public access to these tools through the internet not only
 has increased their dissemination, but also has allowed them to be updated and improved as new knowledge and
 technology become available. The use of these science-based tools has facilitated a broader application of current
 knowledge to post-fire management in the United States and in other fire-prone areas around the world.

$Abstract=Remotely sensed imagery provides a useful tool for land managers to assess the extent and severity of
 post-wildfire salvage logging disturbance. This investigation uses high resolution QuickBird and
 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) imagery to map soil exposure after ground-based salvage operations.
 Three wildfires with varying post-fire salvage activities and variable ground truth data were used to evaluate the
 utility of remotely sensed imagery for disturbance classification.
 The Red Eagle Fire in northwestern Montana had intensive ground truthing with GPS-equipment logging equipment to map their travel paths,
 the Tripod Fire in north central Washington had ground truthed disturbance transects, and
 the School Fire in southeastern Washington had no salvage-specific ground truthing but pre- and post-salvage images were available.
 Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and principle component analysis (PCA) were used to evaluate the imagery. Our results
 showed that soil exposure (disturbance) was measureable when pre- and post-salvage QuickBird images were compared at
 one site.
 At two of the sites, only post-salvage imagery was available, and the soil exposure correlated well to salvage logging
 equipment disturbance at one site.
 When ground disturbance transects were compared to NAIP imagery two years after the salvage operation, it was difficult
 to identify disturbance due to vegetation regrowth.
 These results indicate that soil exposure (ground disturbance) by salvage operation can be detected with remotely sensed
 imagery especially if the images are taken less than two years after the salvage operation.

$Abstract=Many forests and their associated water resources are at increasing risk from large and severe wildfires due to
 high fuel accumulations and climate change. Extensive fuel treatments are being proposed, but it is not clear where such
 treatments should be focussed. The goals of this project were to:
  (1) predict potential post-fire erosion rates for forests and
 shrublands in the western United States to help prioritise fuel treatments; and
  (2) assess model sensitivity and accuracy.
 Post-fire ground cover was predicted using historical fire weather data and the First Order Fire Effects Model. Parameter
 files from the Disturbed Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) were combined with GeoWEPP to predict post-fire
 erosion at the hillslope scale. Predicted median annual erosion rates were 0.1&ndash;2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> year <sup>-1</sup>
 for most of the intermountain west, ~ 10&ndash;40 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> year <sup>-1</sup> for wetter areas along the
 Pacific Coast and up to 100 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> year <sup>-1</sup> for north-western California.
 Sensitivity analyses showed the predicted erosion rates were predominantly controlled by the
 amount of precipitation rather than surface cover. The limited validation dataset showed a reasonable correlation between
 predicted and measured erosion rates (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.61), although predictions were much less than measured values. Our results
demonstrate the feasibility of predicting post-fire erosion rates on a large scale. The validation and sensitivity analysis
indicated that the predictions are most useful for prioritising fuel reduction treatments on a local rather than interregional
scale, and they also helped identify model improvements and research needs.

$Title=The Effectiveness of Aerial Hydromulch as an Erosion Control Treatment in Burned Chaparral Watersheds, Southern California.
$Year=2011
$Authors=Robichaud
$category=conference proceedings
$Publisher=
$Abstract=High severity wildfire can make watersheds susceptible to accelerated erosion that may impede resource recovery
 and threaten life, property, and infrastructure in downstream human communities.
 Land managers often use mitigation measures on the burned hillside slopes to control post-fire sediment fluxes as the
 first step in ecosystem restoration and to protect human developments.
 Aerial hydromulch, a slurry of paper or wood fiber that dries to a permeable crust, is a relatively new erosion control
 treatment that has not been rigorously field tested in wildland settings.
 Concerns have been raised over the ability of aerial hydromulch to reduce watershed erosion along with its potential
 for negative impacts on post-fire ecosystem recovery.
 Since 2007 we have measured sediment fluxes and vegetation development on plots treated operationally with aerial
 hydromulch and compared them to untreated controls after three separate wildfires in southern California.
 These study plots, located on steep slopes with coarse upland soils previously covered with mixed chaparral,
 were monitored with silt fences to trap eroded sediment and meter-square quadrats to measure ground and vegetation cover.
 We found that aerial hydromulch did reduce bare ground on the treated plots and that some of this cover persisted through
 the first post-fire winter rainy season.
 Aerial hydromulch reduced hillslope erosion from small and medium rainstorms, but not during an extreme high intensity
 rain event.  Hydromulch had no effect on regrowing plant cover, shrub seedling density, or species richness.
 Thus, in chaparral watersheds, aerial hydromulch appears to be an effective post-fire erosion control measure that is
 environmentally benign.

$Publisher=
$Abstract=Wildfires often produce large increases in runoff and erosion rates (e.g., Moody and
 Martin, 2009), and land managers need to predict the frequency and magnitude of postfire
 erosion to determine the needs for hazard response and possible erosion mitigation to
 reduce the impacts of increased erosion on public safety and valued resources. The Water
 Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) hillslope erosion model uses parameters based on
 field measurements to calculate the interrill and rill components of erosion (Nearing et al.,
 1989). Since rill erosion is the dominant hillslope erosion process in burned forests
 (Pietraszek, 2006), Robichaud et al. (2010) used simulated runoff experiments to compare
 rill erosion rates among unburned and burned forest plots in the western U.S. These
 experiments provided measurements of the magnitude of rill erosion in burned areas as
 compared to rates in unburned areas and also were used to calculate the rill erosion
 parameters needed for accurate prediction of post-fire erosion rates.

$Title=Getting results: measuring post-wildfire erosion control treatment effectiveness.
$Year=2011

$Abstract=In the past decade, wildfires around the world have continued to increase in size, severity, and cost.
 The number of people living in wildland areas has also increased, putting public safety, homes, roads,
 public infrastructure, water quality, and valued natural resources at risk from wildfire and secondary
 fire effects. Major concerns after wildfires are the increased runoff and erosion due to loss of the
 protective forest floor layer, loss of water storage, and creation of water repellent soil conditions. To
 reduce the potential postfire erosion and flooding, various postfire mitigation treatments are commonly
 used on highly erodible areas. We have developed and implemented rapid response approaches to
 compare treatment effectiveness by monitoring sediment yield and runoff response from hillslopes and
 small catchments. High-intensity rainfall simulation and concentrated flow (rill) experiments are done
 to compare treated and untreated areas within a burned area. Small watershed impoundments and/or
 sediment fence barriers are established within weeks following a forest fire and are monitored for three
 to five years to measure runoff and sediment yields from natural rainfall. These rapid response
 protocols allow measurements to be made during the first postfire year when runoff and erosion are
 likely to be greatest with continued monitoring through the initial recovery period. Our study sites in
 the Western U.S. encompass a range of rainfall regimes including monsoonal rains in the southwest
 (Arizona and New Mexico), thunderstorms in the Colorado Front Range and Northern Rockies, and
 wet frontal systems in Southern California. A paired watershed study that examined the effectiveness
 of contour-felled log erosion barriers found that runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields were generally
 lower on the treated sites compared to the control sites for lower intensity storms (storms with less than
 a 2-yr, 10-min maximum rainfall intensity return interval I<sub>10-min</sub>); however for higher intensity storms
 (2-yr or greater return interval I<sub>10-min</sub>) there was no detectable treatment effect. Mulch treatments
 (agricultural straw, wood shreds or wood strands) appear to out-perform the barrier-type treatments in
 reducing erosion and can be effective even for the higher intensity events. Our research results have
 brought a shift in post-wildfire erosion management strategies. For example, in the 1990's contour-felled
 log erosion barriers were commonly used to mitigate hillslope erosion on forested landscapes;
 but this treatment is seldom used today. Since 2002, mulches, especially agricultural straw, are
 increasingly used for post-fire hillslope stabilization.

$Title=Wind erosion of soils burned by wildfire
$Year=2011
$Authors=Copeland, Foltz, Robichaud
$category=
$Publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers
$Abstract=Wind erosion and aeolian transport processes are largely unstudied in the post-wildfire environment,
 but recent studies have shown that wind erosion can play a major role in burned landscapes. A wind
 erosion monitoring system was installed immediately following a wildfire in southeastern Idaho, USA
 to measure wind erosion from the burned area. This paper describes initial findings related
 to horizontal sediment flux and PM<sub>10</sub> (particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10&nbsp;&mu;m) emissions
 from the burned area. Several wind erosion events were monitored in the months following the fire.
 The largest wind erosion event to-date occurred in early September 2010 and produced 570&nbsp;kg&nbsp;m<sup>-1</sup> of
 horizontal sediment transport within the first meter above the soil surface and generated a large dust
 plume that was visible in satellite imagery. The peak PM<sub>10</sub> concentration measured on-site at a height
 of 2&nbsp;m in the downwind portion of the burned area was 690&nbsp;mg&nbsp;m<sup>-3</sup>. Measured horizontal sediment
 fluxes and PM<sub>10</sub> vertical fluxes are on the upper end of values reported in the wind erosion literature.
 These initial results indicate that wildfire can convert a relatively wind-resistant landscape into one that
 produces as much soil and dust as some of the most wind erodible landscapes known, including the US
 southern high plains and the Loess Plateau in China.

$Title=Probabilistic soil erosion modeling using the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) after wildfires.
$Year=2011
$Authors=Robichaud, Elliot, Wagenbrenner
$category=
$Publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers
$Abstract=The decision of whether or not to apply post-fire hillslope erosion mitigation treatments, and if so,
 where these treatments are most needed, is a multi-step process. Land managers must assess the risk of
 damaging runoff and sediment delivery events occurring on the unrecovered burned hillslope. We
 developed the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) to address this need. ERMiT is a web-based
 application that uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) technology to estimate sediment
 delivery, in probabilistic terms, on burned and recovering forest, range, and chaparral lands with and
 without the application of mitigation treatments. User inputs are processed by ERMiT to combine rain
 event variability with spatial and temporal variability of soil burn severity and soil properties, which
 are then used as WEPP input parameter values. Based on 20 to 40 individual WEPP runs, ERMiT
 produces a distribution of single sediment delivery rates with a probability of occurrence for each of
 five postfire years. In addition, sediment delivery rate distributions are generated for postfire hillslopes
 that have been treated with seeding, straw mulch, and erosion barriers such as contour-felled logs or
 straw wattles. Using postfire sediment data from 21 small instrumented watersheds (&lt; 14 ha), we
 compared each storm.s measured sediment delivery to the ERMiT-predicted delivery. Observed
 delivery rates were within the predicted range of values 77 percent of the time, with 14 percent of the
 observed values being greater than the estimated range, and 9 percent being less than the predicted
 range. Most of the under predictions were associated with studies in the Colorado Front Range. The
 ERMiT tool tended to over predict sediment delivery in the Northern Rockies and in California. Only 3
 percent of the observed delivery events were associated with snow melt processes, whereas 36 percent
 of the predicted values were influenced by snow melt. Based on these results, we are considering
 improvements such as incorporating erodibility values for more forest soil types, adjusting the weather
 characteristics in the climate generator, and reducing the occurrence of snow melt erosion response.
 Postfire assessment teams are actively using the ERMiT model for making hillslope mitigation
 treatment decisions based on the probability of damaging sediment delivery occurring after a wildfire.

$Title=Erosion processes and prediction in NW U.S. forests.
$Year=2011
$Authors=Elliot, Robichaud, Foltz
$category=
$Publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers
$Abstract=The greatest amounts of forest erosion usually follow infrequent wildfires. Sediment from these fires is
 gradually routed through the stream system. The forest road network is usually the second greatest source of
 sediment, generating sediment annually. Erosion rates associated with timber harvest, biomass removal, and
 prescribed fire are generally minimal with current management practices. Landslides and debris flows can
 contribute significant amounts of sediment during infrequent wet years, or following wildfire. A relatively new
 source of sediment in forested watersheds is from recreation, particularly all-terrain vehicle trails. Stream
 channels store and route sediment, but in the absence of channel disturbance, tend to reach an equilibrium
 condition where sediment entering a given reach is balanced by sediment carried on downstream. At times this
 sediment from roads, wildfire or landslides may accumulate in channels until higher flow rates, often associated
 with rainfall on melting snow, flush it downstream. Predictive tools to aid in estimating long term, low level
 sedimentation from undisturbed forests, and erosion from sediment delivery from roads, and short term, event
 driven sediment from disturbed forests have been developed. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP)
 model has been parameterized for these surface erosion processes, and soil and vegetation databases for these
 conditions are distributed with the WEPP Windows interface, and our online and GIS interfaces. The internet
 interfaces were developed to allow users to more easily predict soil erosion for a wide range of climatic and
 forest conditions, including roads, fires, and timber harvest. The interfaces have been designed to allow users to
 compare the effects of the most common management practices for each application.

$Abstract=Broadcast seeding is one of the most commonly used post-fire rehabilitation treatments to establish ground cover
 for erosion control and mitigation of non-native plant species invasions. Little quantitative information is available on
 overall trends of post-fire seeding expenditures and seed mixes used over time in forested ecosystems in the western USA.
 We reviewed scientific articles, government publications and unpublished documents as well as USDA Forest Service Burned
 Area Reports to determine trends in post-fire seeding in forested ecosystems over time. Of 1164 USDA Forest Service Burned
 Area Reports, 380 contained information on seeding treatments conducted in forested ecosystems.
 A review of 40 papers and 67 Burned Area Reports reporting species seeded between 1970 and 2007 revealed a trend of
 increasing use of native species, annual cereal grains and sterile-grass hybrids, with natives dominating seed mixes.
 According to 380 Burned Area Reports with data on costs and area seeded, total post-fire seeding expenditures have
 increased substantially, averaging US$3.3 million per year spent on post-fire emergency seeding treatments in forested
 ecosystems that involved the Forest Service during the period 2000 to 2007 &ndash; an increase of 192% compared with the
 average spent during the previous 30 years. The percentage of the total burned area seeded averaged 21% in the 1970s,
 compared with only 4% between 2000 and 2007.

 allometric differences prior to hardening. Subsequent release of immobilized N during the onset of hardening, when daily N
 flux decreased from 4.2% to 1.6%, allowed PS seedlings to avoid foliar N dilution experienced by PV seedlings. Media
 yielded seedlings with similar final morphological characteristics, although PS seedlings had improved N status. At onset,
 particle density and volumetric water content were similar for both media, but PS held about 10% more water than PV at all
 water potentials at experiment conclusion. Exposure to the driest water content (44%) decreased seedling growth and root N

$Abstract=Agricultural straw mulch is a commonly applied treatment for protecting resources
 at risk from runoff and erosion events after wildfires. High-resolution QuickBird
 satellite imagery was acquired after straw mulch was applied on the 2006 Tripod
 Fire in Washington. We tested whether the imagery was suitable for remotely assessing
 the areal coverage of the straw mulch treatment.
 Straw mulch was easily identified in the imagery because of the distinct spectral
 signature of the mulch against the burned background. The measured straw cover on
 the ground was correlated to the modeled cover in the imagery with a correlation
 coefficient of r = 0.47, and a rank analysis indicated the ability to predict relative
 straw cover amounts on the plots with a rank correlation of &rho; = 0.40. Better correlations
 may be possible if the time between the image acquisition and field validation
 was shorter. Our results encourage further exploration of the use of high-resolution
 imagery for research applications and postfire management.

$Abstract=Wildfire is a major forest disturbance in interior Alaska that can both directly and indirectly alter ecological
 processes. We used a combination of pre- and post-fire forest floor depths and post-fire ground cover assessments
 measured in the field, and high-resolution airborne hyperspectral imagery, to map forest floor conditions after the 2004
 Taylor Complex in Alaska.s boreal forest. We applied a linear spectral unmixing model with five endmembers
 representing green moss, non-photosynthetic moss, charred moss, ash and soil to reflectance data to produce fractional
 cover maps. Our study sites spanned low to moderately high burn severity, and both black and white spruce forest types;
 high cover of green or non-photosynthetic moss in the remotely sensed imagery indicated low consumption, whereas high
 cover of charred moss, ash or soil indicated higher consumption. Strong relationships (R<sup>2</sup>=0.5 to 0.6) between green moss
 estimated from the imagery and both post-fire depth and percentage consumption suggest that potential burn severity may
 be predicted by a map of green (live) moss. Given that the depth of the post-fire forest floor is ecologically significant, the
 method of mapping the condition of the organic forest floor with hyperspectral imagery presented here may be a useful tool
 to assess the effect of future fires in the boreal region.

$Publisher=
$Abstract=The Water Erosion Prediction Project Climate Assessment Tool (WEPPCAT) was
 developed to be an easy-to-use, web-based erosion model that allows users to adjust climate
 inputs for user-specified climate scenarios. WEPPCAT allows the user to modify monthly mean
 climate parameters, including maximum and minimum temperatures, number of wet days,
 precipitation, and precipitation intensity (change in heavy precipitation events) in order to assess
 changes in surface runoff and soil erosion. In addition, the model allows the user to assess the
 impacts of a variety of land management alternatives including riparian filter strips. An
 important aspect of the tool is that databases for the model are pre-constructed; therefore, it does
 not require specialized scientific expertise to run, and scenarios are quick and easy to set up.
 This paper presents the conceptual and technical basis for WEPPCAT, and an example
 application is given for sediment delivery on a transect running north-south from Minnesota to
 Louisiana under several climate change scenarios.

$Abstract=The water erosion prediction project (WEPP) model is a physically-based hydrology and erosion model.
 In recent years, the hydrology prediction within the model has been improved for forest watershed modeling by
 incorporating shallow lateral flow into watershed runoff prediction.
 This has greatly improved WEPP's hydrologic performance on small watersheds with seasonal flows,
 but the current version of WEPP is not capable of estimating base flow rates which are more important on larger watersheds.
 This paper presents a method under development to accumulate the daily deep seepage values estimated by WEPP,
 and return a fraction of that deep seepage to channel flow each day, resulting in reasonable base flow estimates.
 The modeling principles and processes will be described, suggested values for hydrologic parameters will be presented,
 and areas requiring additional research to support this approach will be presented.
 Examples of the application to forested watersheds in the Lake Tahoe Basin and northern Idaho will be presented.

$Abstract=The assessment teams who make post-fire stabilization and treatment decisions are under pressure to employ
 more effective and economic post-fire treatments, as wild fire activity and severity has increased in recent years
 across the western United States.
 Use of forest-native wood-based materials for hillslope mulching has been on the rise due to potential environmental,
 erosion control efficacy, and economic incentives. One concern regarding use of woody materials prepared on or near
 burned sites is the wide range in the size distribution of the shredded materials.
 We tested three blends of shredded woody materials, each blend containing different amounts of fine
 (less than 2.5 cm in length) woody particles.
 The blends (AS IS with 24% fines, MIX with 18% fines, and REDUCED with 2% fines) were applied at 50 and 70% ground cover
 to 5-m<sup>2</sup> plots containing burned soil placed at 40% slope and evaluated through simulated rain events
 which consisted of a rain only, a rain plus low flow, and a rain plus high flow period.
 The REDUCED blend was the optimum for both runoff and sediment concentration reduction under conditions of rainfall
 and rainfall plus concentrated flow.
 There was no difference between application rates of 50 and 70% for either of the rainfall plus concentrated flows tested.
 Our recommendation was that 50% ground cover of the REDUCED blend was adequate for both rainfall and sediment reduction
 compared to a bare soil.
 The other two blends were effective in reducing runoff but not sediment concentration compared to a bare soil.
 The wood shred manufacturing and blending process resulted in two statistically different relationships between
 application rate and ground cover; relationships were controlled by the amount of fines.

$Abstract=Following a wildfire in the Santa Ana Mountains of northeast Orange County, California,
 a monitoring project was established to test whether aerial hydromulch reduced post-fire hillslope and
 small watershed erosion, and to document its impact on re-growing vegetation.
 The study site received below normal rainfall both the first and second winters after the fire.
 A high-intensity thunderstorm at the end of May 2008 produced very high peak rainfall intensities,
 providing an extreme test for the hydromulch.
 It appears that the mulch reduced hillslope erosion during low and moderate rainstorms, but not during heavy downpours.
 Once the hydromulch is removed, the sites are susceptible to erosion during subsequent higher intensity storms.
 Because the spatial differences in the rainfall were confounded with the treatment and control locations,
 the effect of the hydromulch on stream channel erosion is unknown.
 Cover assessments showed that the hydromulch did significantly reduce bare ground on the hillsides,
 and that this cover persisted until the time of the intense thunderstorm.
 Differences in pre-fire shrub composition and post-fire herbaceous species composition makes it impossible
 to separate the hydromulch effects from inherent site differences on plant response, suggesting that
 there was no treatment effect on vegetation recovery.

$Abstract=As forest management scenarios become more complex, the ability to more
 accurately predict erosion from those scenarios becomes more important. In this second
 part of a two.part study we report model parameters based on 66 simulated runoff
 experiments in two disturbed forests in the northwestern U.S. The 5 disturbance classes
 were natural, 10-month old and 2-week old low soil burn severity, high soil burn
 severity, and logging skid trails. In these environments the erosion rates were clearly
 detachment limited, and the rill erodibility parameters calculated from four hydraulic
 variables increased by orders of magnitude. The soil shear stress based erodibility
 parameter, <i>K<sub>r</sub></i>, was 1.5 � 10<sup>-6</sup> s m<sup>-1</sup> in the natural plots,
 2.0 � 10<sup>-4</sup> s m<sup>-1</sup> in the high soil
 burn severity plots, and 1.7 � 10<sup>-3</sup> s m<sup>-1</sup> in the skid trail plots; <i>K<sub>r</sub></i> values for the low soil
 burn severity plots had negative sign. The erodibility value for the skid trail plots fell
 within ranges reported for tilled agricultural fields and also for forest roads. The <i>K<sub>r</sub></i> values
 decreased as erosion occurred in the plots and therefore should not be a constant
 parameter. The stream power produced the largest <i>R<sup>2</sup></i> value (0.41) when hydraulic
 predictors and the sediment flux were log.transformed, but none of the four hydraulic
 variables (soil shear stress, stream power, unit stream power, and unit length shear force)
 explained much of the variability in sediment flux rates across the five levels of
 disturbance when evaluated in the linear form of the erosion models under consideration.

$Abstract=Rill erosion can be a large portion of the total erosion in disturbed forests, but
 measurements of the runoff and erosion at the rill scale are uncommon. Simulated rill
 erosion experiments were conducted in two forested areas in the northwestern United
 States on slopes ranging from 18 to 79%. We compared runoff rates, runoff velocities, and
 sediment flux rates from natural (undisturbed) forests and in forests either burned at low
 soil burn severity (10 months or 2 weeks post-fire), high soil burn severity, or subject to
 skidding of felled logs. The runoff rates and velocities in the natural sites
 (2.7 L min<sup>-1</sup> and 0.016 m s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively) were lower than those in all the disturbed sites
 (12 to 21 L min<sup>-1</sup> and 0.19 to 0.31 m s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively), except for the 10-month old low
 soil burn severity site where the velocity (0.073 m s<sup>-1</sup>) was indistinguishable from the
 natural sites. The mean sediment flux rate in the natural sites also was very small
 (1.3 � 10.5 kg s<sup>-1</sup>) as compared to the rates in the disturbed areas (2.5 � 10.4 to
 0.011 kg s<sup>-1</sup>). The hillslope gradient did not affect the runoff or sediment responses. The
 sediment flux rates generally were greater in the initial stage of each inflow period than in the
 steady state condition, but there was no corresponding transient effect in runoff rates. Rill
 erosion modeling implications based on these data are presented in part 2 of this study.

$Abstract=This synthesis of post-fire treatment effectiveness reviews the past decade of research, monitoring, and
 product development related to post-fire hillslope emergency stabilization treatments, including erosion barriers,
 mulching, chemical soil treatments, and combinations of these treatments.
 In the past ten years, erosion barrier treatments (contour-felled logs and straw wattles) have declined in use and
 are now rarely applied as a post-fire hillslope treatment.
 In contrast, dry mulch treatments (agricultural straw, wood strands, wood shreds, etc.) have quickly gained
 acceptance as effective, though somewhat expensive, post-fire hillslope stabilization treatments and are frequently
 recommended when values-at-risk warrant protection.
 This change has been motivated by research that shows the proportion of exposed mineral soil (or conversely, the
 proportion of ground cover) to be the primary treatment factor controlling post-fire hillslope erosion.
 Erosion barrier treatments provide little ground cover and have been shown to be less effective than mulch,
 especially during short-duration, high intensity rainfall events.
 In addition, innovative options for producing and applying mulch materials have adapted these materials for use on
 large burned areas that are inaccessible by road.
 Although longer-term studies on mulch treatment effectiveness are on-going, early results and short-term studies have
 shown that dry mulches can be highly effective in reducing post-fire runoff and erosion.
 Hydromulches have been used after some fires, but they have been less effective than dry mulches in stabilizing
 burned hillslopes and generally decompose or degrade within a year.

$Abstract=As the severity and extent of wildfires increase, efforts to reduce forest densities on public lands
 by thinning and prescribed burning also are increasing. The intentional suppression of fires in the western United States,
 beginning in the early 1900s, has altered the extent, frequency, and severity of wildfires (Agee 1993; Baker 1993).
 Reductions in timber harvest and in grazing, when combined with the suppression of wildfires, have resulted in
 higher fuel loadings, which increase the risk of high severity wildfires (Norris 1990).
 Changes in the fire regime may also cause vegetation changes, such as increases in tree stand density,
 spread of noxious weeds, and tree invasion into grasslands (Arno and Gruell 1986).
 Any increase in high severity wildfires is of considerable concern because of the potential damage to life and property
 and the adverse effects on water quality, fish habitat, and other aquatic resources (Keane and others 2002).
 The goal of most fuel management efforts is to reduce the potential adverse effects due to increased frequency of large,
 high severity wildfires.
 Although forest managers attempt to minimize impacts of fuel management activities, the removal of vegetation and the
 alteration of soil properties due to logging, road building, and prescribed fire may affect site conditions,
 forest runoff, and water quality (Lindeburgh 1990; Lousier 1990; Rice and Datzman 1981; Tiedemann and others 1979).

$Abstract=Fire suppression in the last century has resulted in forests with excessive amounts of biomass,
 leading to more severe wildfires, covering greater areas, requiring more resources for suppression and mitigation,
 and causing increased onsite and offsite damage to forests and watersheds.
 Forest managers are now attempting to reduce this accumulated biomass by thinning, prescribed fire, and other
 management activities.
 These activities will impact watershed health, particularly as larger areas are treated and treatment activities
 become more widespread in space and in time.
 Management needs, laws, social pressures, and legal findings have underscored a need to synthesize what we know
 about the cumulative watershed effects of fuel management activities.
 To meet this need, a workshop was held in Provo, Utah, on April, 2005, with 45 scientists and watershed managers
 from throughout the United States.
 At that meeting, it was decided that two syntheses on the cumulative watershed effects of fuel management would be
 developed, one for the eastern United States, and one for the western United States.
 For the western synthesis, 14 chapters were defined covering fire and forests, machinery, erosion processes,
 water yield and quality, soil and riparian impacts, aquatic and landscape effects, and predictive tools and procedures.
 We believe these chapters provide an overview of our current understanding of the cumulative watershed effects of
 fuel management in the western United States.

$Abstract=The 2000 Bitterroot Valley wildfires provided an opportunity to measure post-fire
 effects and recovery rates. We established 24 small (0.01 ha [0.02 acre]) plots in
 four high-severity burn sites. We measured sediment yields at each site with silt
 fences. We also measured rainfall characteristics, soil water repellency, vegetative
 cover, and other site characteristics. The median sediment yield in post-fire year 1
 was 8 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (3.6 ton acre<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>),
 and values ranged from 0.3 to 47 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (0.1 to 21 ton acre<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>).
 Sediment yields were lower in post-fire years 2 and 3, with medians of
 2 and 0.3 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup> (0.9 and 0.1 ton acre<sup>-1</sup> yr<sup>-1</sup>), respectively.
 The high variability in sediment yields was related to 10-minute maximum rainfall
 intensity (<b>I</b><sub>10</sub>), but not to soil water repellency or vegetative cover. The results of this
 study may assist in decisions about post-wildfire land management.

$Abstract=This study measured runoff and sediment concentration from the tire track and from the non-tire track
 to determine infiltration, interrill erodibility, and vegetative cover impacts of reopening an abandoned
 forest road. Runoff was lowest on the non-track portion of the abandoned road and highest on the
 reopened road. Sediment concentrations were significantly higher on the reopened road. Increased
 sediment concentrations were attributed to decreased vegetative cover, rather than traffic-induced
 changes in the physical soil properties of the reopened road. Thirty years of no traffic and vegetation
 regrowth was not sufficient to allow recovery of infiltration to values similar to an undisturbed forest.
 The study also found a significant dynamic behavior in interrill erodibility with respect to antecedent
 rainfall. Forest road erosion models that fail to account for this change will overestimate sediment yields.

$Abstract=Major concerns after bushfires and wildfires include increased flooding, erosion and debris flows
due to loss of the protective forest floor layer, loss of water storage, and creation of water repellent soil
conditions. To assist postfire assessment teams in their efforts to evaluate fire effects and make postfire
treatment decisions, a web-based Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) has been developed. ERMiT uses
the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to predict postfire hillslope erosion and to evaluate the
potential effectiveness of some common hillslope erosion mitigation practices. The model uses a probabilistic
approach that incorporates variability in climate, soil properties, and burn severity for forests, rangeland, and
chaparral hillslopes. For user specified climate, burn severity, and soil conditions, ERMiT produces a
distribution of erosion rates with a likelihood of their occurrence for each of five years after the fire. ERMiT
also provides single-event erosion rate distributions for hillslopes that have been treated with seed, straw
mulch, and erosion barriers. ERMiT's outputs help managers establish the probability associated with a given
level of sediment yield for a given location, and this information can be used along with information about
the value of resources at risk and acceptable loss thresholds to make postfire erosion treatment decisions. The
objectives of this paper are to describe: 1) the conceptual framework and components of the ERMiT model;
and 2) an application of ERMiT from 2009 Victoria, Australia bushfires.

$Abstract=Sediment is the greatest pollutant of forest streams. In the absence of wildfire, forest road
networks are usually the main source of sediment in forest watersheds. An understanding of forest road
erosion processes is important to aid in predicting sediment delivery from roads to streams. The flowpath
followed by runoff is the key to understanding road erosion processes. On rutted roads, the flowpath
follows ruts until a cross drain structure or change of grade is encountered, leading to considerable
sediment delivery. Insloping roads to bare ditches can lead to ditch erosion, but if the ditch is graveled or
vegetated, erosion is generally minimal. Outsloping a road minimizes the flow path length on the road,
minimizing surface erosion, and runoff is dispersed along the hillside, minimizing delivery. If roads have
low or no traffic, the road surface may become armored, reducing erosion rates by 70 to 80 percent. If there
is no traffic, and a road becomes covered in vegetation, erosion may drop 99 percent, but the hydraulic
conductivity of the road surface is only minimally affected. In many cases, forest buffers absorb road
runoff, minimizing the delivery of road sediment to streams. Buffers are less effective in wetter climates in
absorbing runoff and reducing sediment delivery. Cutslopes can erode, making sediment readily available
to be transported from roads. Graveling reduces the likelihood of rut formation, generally leading to a
significant decline in road erosion. Traffic, however, can reduce the effectiveness of gravel by pressing it
into the subgrade, or breaking it down. Paving a road will reduce road surface erosion, but may increase
erosion in road ditches and on the hillsides or channels in a buffer area. If water is delivered from road
cross drains to a channel, the chances of delivering sediment increases, as does the chance of entraining
additional sediment through channel erosion. Empirical (USLE and SEDMODL) and process-based
(KINEROS and WEPP) models have been applied to road erosion. SEDMODL and WEPP have been
specifically adopted to model road erosion, and to account for the important detachment and delivery
processes. A version of WEPP is available online that is receiving widespread use in the USA and
throughout the world. This tool can either analyze single segments of road between cross drains, or can
analyze up to 200 segments in a single run. Areas needing to be improved in road erosion are modeling the
armoring process within a storm, developing the probabilistic capabilities of WEPP for road applications,
adding mass wasting to the WEPP technology and expanding the WEPP road soil database.

$Abstract=Appropriate use of satellite data in predicting &gt;1 year post-fire effects requires remote measurement of surface
 properties that can be mechanistically related to ground measures of post-fire condition. The present study of burned
 ponderosa pine (<i>Pinus ponderosa</i>) forests in the Black Hills of South Dakota evaluates whether immediate fractional cover
 estimates of char, green vegetation and brown (non-photosynthetic) vegetation within a pixel are improved predictors of
 1-year post-fire field measures,when compared with single-date and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR and dNBR)
 indices. The modeled estimate of immediate char fraction either equaled or outperformed all other immediate metrics in
 predicting 1-year post-fire effects. Brown cover fraction was a poor predictor of all effects (r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.30), and each remote
 measure produced only poor predictions of crown scorch (r<sup>2</sup> &lt; 0.20). Application of dNBR (1 year post) provided a considerable
 increase in regression performance for predicting tree survival. Immediate post-fire NBR or dNBR produced only
 marginal differences in predictions of all the 1-year post-fire effects, perhaps limiting the need for prefire imagery.
 Although
 further research is clearly warranted to evaluate fire effects data available 2.20 years after fire, char and green vegetation
 fractions may be viable alternatives to dNBR and similar indices to predict longer-term post-fire ecological effects.

$Abstract=The predicted continuation of strong drying and warming trends in the southwestern United States
 underlies the associated prediction of increased frequency, area, and severity of wildfires in the coming years.
 As a result, the management of wildfires and fire effects on public lands will continue to be a major
 land management priority for the foreseeable future.
 Following fire suppression, the first land management process to occur on burned public lands is the rapid assessment
 and emergency treatment recommendations provided by the Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) team.
 These teams of specialists follow a dynamic protocol to make post-fire treatment decisions based on the
 best available information using a range of landscape assessment, predictive modeling, and informational tools
 in combination with their collective professional expertise.
 Because the mission of a BAER team is to assess burned landscape and determine if stabilization treatments
 are needed to protect valued resources from the immediate fire effects, the evaluation of treatment success
 generally does not include important longer term ecological effects of these treatments or the fates of the
 materials applied over the burned landscape.
 New tools and techniques that have been designed or modified for BAER team use are presented in conjunction
 with current post-fire treatment effectiveness monitoring and research.
 In addition, a case is made to monitor longer term treatment effects on recovering ecosystems and to make these
 findings available to BAER teams.

$Abstract=There has been an increasing public concern over forest stream pollution by excessive sedimentation
 due to natural or human disturbances.
 Adequate erosion simulation tools are needed for sound management of forest resources.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) watershed model has proved useful in forest applications
 where Hortonian flow is the major form of runoff, such as modeling erosion from roads, harvested units,
 and burned areas by wildfire or prescribed fire.
 Nevertheless, when used for modeling water flow and sediment discharge from natural forest watersheds
 where subsurface flow is dominant, WEPP (v2004.7) underestimates these quantities, in particular,
 the water flow at the watershed outlet.
 <br><br>
 The main goal of this study was to improve the WEPP v2004.7 so that it can be applied to adequately simulate
 forest watershed hydrology and erosion.
 The specific objectives were to modify WEPP v2004.7 algorithms and subroutines that improperly represent forest subsurface
 hydrologic processes; and, to assess the performance of the modified model by applying it to a research forest watershed
 in the Pacific Northwest, USA.
 <br><br>
 Changes were made in WEPP v2004.7 to better model percolation of soil water and subsurface lateral flow.
 The modified model, WEPP v2008.9, was applied to the Hermada watershed located in the Boise National Forest,
 in southern Idaho, USA. The results from v2008.9 and v2004.7 as well as the field observations were compared.
 For the period of 1995.2000, average annual precipitation for the study area was 954 mm.
 Simulated annual watershed discharge was negligible using WEPP v2004.7, and was 262 mm using WEPP v2008.9,
 agreeable with field-observed 275 mm.

$Abstract=We synthesized post-fire road treatment information to assist BAER specialists in making road rehabilitation decisions.
 We developed a questionnaire; conducted 30 interviews of BAER team engineers and hydrologists; acquired and analyzed gray
 literature and other relevant publications; and reviewed road rehabilitation procedures and analysis tools.
 Post-fire road treatments are implemented if the values at risk warrant the treatment and based on regional
 characteristics, including the timing of first damaging storm and window of implementation.
 Post-fire peak flow estimation is important when selecting road treatments.
 Interview results indicate that USGS methods are used for larger watersheds (&gt;5 mi<sup>2</sup>)
 and NRCS Curve Number methods are used for smaller watersheds (&lt;5 mi<sup>2</sup>).
 These methods are not parameterized and validated for post-fire conditions.
 Many BAER team members used their own rules to determine parameter values for USGS regression and NRCS CN methods;
 therefore, there is no consistent way to estimate postfire peak flow.
 Many BAER road treatments for individual stream crossings were prescribed based on road/culvert surveys,
 without considering capacities of existing road structure and increased post-fire peak flow.
 For all regions, rolling dips/water bars, culvert upgrading, and ditch cleaning/armoring are the most frequently
 used road treatments.
 For Forest Service Regions 1 and 4, culvert upgrading is preferred, especially for fish-bearing streams.
 For Forest Service Region 3, culvert removal with temporary road closure and warning signs is preferred.
 Except for culverts, insufficient data is available on other road treatments to estimate their capacity and
 to evaluate their effectiveness.

$Abstract=Fugitive dust from eroding land poses risks to environmental quality and human health, and thus,
 is regulated nationally based on ambient air quality standards for particulate matter with mean aerodynamic diameter
 &le; 10 &micro;m (PM<sub>10</sub>) established in the Clean Air Act.
 Agricultural straw has been widely used for rainfall-induced erosion control;
 however, its performance for wind erosion mitigation has been less studied,
 in part because straw is mobile at moderate wind velocities.
 A wood-based long-strand material has been developed for rainfall-induced erosion control and has shown operational
 promise for control of wind-induced erosion and dust emissions from disturbed sites.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of both agricultural straw and wood-strand materials in
 controlling wind erosion and fugitive dust emissions under laboratory conditions.
 Wind tunnel tests were conducted to compare wood strands of several geometries to agricultural wheat straw and bare soil
 in terms of total sediment loss, PM<sub>10</sub> vertical flux, and PM<sub>10</sub> loss.
 Results indicate that the types of wood strands tested are stable at wind speeds of up to 18 m s<sup>-1</sup>,
 while wheat straw is only stable at speeds of up to 6.5 m s<sup>-1</sup>.
 Wood strands reduced total sediment loss and PM<sub>10</sub> emissions by 90% as compared to bare soil across the range
 of wind speeds tested.
 Wheat straw did not reduce total sediment loss for the range of speeds tested, but did reduce PM<sub>10</sub> emissions
 by 75% compared to a bare soil at wind speeds of up to 11 m s<sup>-1</sup>.

$Abstract=The recent modification of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has improved its applicability to
 hydrology and erosion modeling in forest watersheds. To generate reliable topographic and hydrologic inputs for the WEPP
 model, carefully selecting digital elevation models (DEMs) with appropriate resolution and accuracy is essential because
 topography is a major factor controlling water erosion. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides an alternative
 technology to photogrammetry for generating fine-resolution and high-quality DEMs. In this study, WEPP (v2006.201) was
 applied to hydrological and erosion simulation for two small forest watersheds in northern Idaho. Data on stream flow and
 total suspended solids (TSS) in these watersheds were collected and processed. A total of six DEMs from the National
 Elevation Dataset (NED), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and LiDAR at three resolutions (30&nbsp;m, 10&nbsp;m, and 4&nbsp;m)
 were obtained and used to calculate topographic parameters as inputs to the WEPP model. WEPP-simulated hydrologic and
 erosion results using the six DEMs were contrasted and then compared with field observations. For the study watersheds,
 DEMs with different resolutions and sources generated varied topographic and hydrologic attributes, which in turn led to
 significantly different erosion simulations. WEPP v2006.201 using the 10&nbsp;m LiDAR DEM (vs. using other DEMs) produced
 a total amount of as well as seasonal patterns of watershed discharge and sediment yield that were closest to field
 observations.

$category=

$Abstract=Dense, small-diameter stands generally require thinning from below to improve fire-tolerance.
 The resulting forest biomass can be used for energy production.
 The cost of harvesting, processing, and transporting small-diameter trees often exceeds revenues due to high costs
 associated with harvesting and transportation and low market values for forest biomass.
 Productivity and cost were evaluated in a whole-tree harvesting system on four fuel-reduction thinning treatment units in Arizona.
 Thinning required removal of trees less than 5.0 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH).
 Time studies were applied to evaluate the harvesting productivities and costs.
 Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effects of different variables on costs.
 Simulations along with break-even analysis were used to examine the economic feasibility of using forest biomass for energy.
 Harvest productivity for each machine in the system ranged from 2.31 to 39.32 bone dry tons per productive machine hour (BDT/PMH).
 Harvest system costs including transportation for 36 miles or less averaged $55.27 per bone dry ton.
 Hauling cost represented the largest component (47.24%) of the total cost.
 Close to market operations, reduced off-highway hauling, shortened skidding distance, increased harvest tree size,
 and improvement in system balance could significantly reduce cost.
 Below the market value of $40 per bone dry ton for hog fuel, breaking even or realizing profit would remain difficult.
 Other values, such as reducing fire risks, preventing smoke pollutions, and creating renewable energy sources,
 should increase the attractiveness of harvesting forest biomass for energy.

$Abstract=What amount of extra energy can be generated after subtracting the total energy consumed to produce the
 biomass energy?
 Knowing the ratio between energy output and input is a valid question when highly mechanized systems that consume
 fossil fuels are used to harvest and transport forest biomass for energy.
 We estimated the net energy generated from mechanical fuel reduction thinning treatments on pure ponderosa pine stands in Arizona.
 The mechanized system (felling, skidding, loading, grinding, and hauling) was monitored for energy consumption.
 Potential energy output from harvested forest biomass was calculated based on hog fuel moisture content and heating value.
 A 9-day study showed positive net energy output of 3,471,376,292 BTUs.
 The net energy ratio between energy output and input was 10.41, and the energy cost from stump to energy plant was
 $4.65/million BTUs.
 Energy used for hauling hog fuel represented the largest part (36.27%) of the total energy input.
 The net energy ratio decreased 0.11 with each additional transportation mile.
 Energy cost increased by $0.04/million BTUs, $0.13/million BTUs, and $1.48/million BTUs for each additional
 mile of highway, unpaved road, and spur road, respectively.
 A one dollar per gallon diesel price increase added $0.34/million BTUs to the energy cost.
 Forest biomass energy has an encouraging net energy ratio compared with other biomass sources,
 but the high production cost and energy cost can impede the use of forest biomass for energy.

$Abstract=Quantifying critical conditions of rill formation can be useful for a better understanding of soil erosion processes.
 Current studies lack a consensus and related rationale on how to describe these conditions.
 This study was based on the concepts that
 (1) the shear stress available for erosion at any given point is a function of the runoff rate, the slope steepness,
 and hydraulic characteristics of the surface;
 (2) rill incision begins when overland flow shear stress exceeds soil critical shear stress; and
 (3) the distance from the top of the slope to the point where rills form can be measured and analyzed as length
 to rill initiation and decreases with increase in slope and rainfall intensity.
 These concepts were tested with a representative silty-clay soil from the Loess Plateau in northwestern China
 on a large sloping indoor plot (8 x 3 m), with five different slopes using simulated rainfall at three
 rainfall intensities.
 Values of several hydraulic parameters at rill initiation were determined from the experimental data.
 The results showed relationships among slope steepness, rainfall intensity, and location of rill initiation.
 It was found that slope was relatively more important than rainfall intensity in determining the location of
 rill initiation.
 Soil critical shear stress determined in this study ranged from 1.33 to 2.63 Pa, with an average of 1.94 Pa.
 Soil critical shear stress was inversely related to slope and was not influenced by rainfall intensity.
 The results of this study were comparable with those of previous investigators.

 chipper. The second treatment spread compressed, tackified straw pellets that expand
 when wetted and release a soil flocculant. The third treatment was rice straw applied at 
 4.5&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> (2&nbsp;tons&nbsp;ac<sup>-1</sup>).
 Each treatment was applied to a small catchment with a silt fence
 sediment trap at the mouth. Sediment yield from an untreated (control) catchment was also
 measured. The treatments were tested by three erosion-causing summer rain events. The
 chipping treatment and the pellets reduced sediment yield by 80 to 100 percent compared to
 the control in the first two storms. In the third event, a multi-day storm followed by an intense
 thunderstorm, the pellets and straw reduced sediment yield 42 and 81 percent, respectively.
 The effectiveness of the chip treatment could not be completely assessed because of partial
 failure of the sediment fence. Vegetation cover was low on all sites; ground cover from pellets
 decreased more than did straw or chips by mid-October, probably accounting for the lower
 effectiveness in reducing erosion compared to straw.

$Abstract=Federal land management agencies have spent tens of millions of dollars on post-fire emergency watershed
 stabilization measures intended to minimize flood runoff, peakflows, onsite erosion, offsite sedimentation,
 and other hydrologic damage to natural habitats, roads, bridges, reservoirs, and irrigation systems
 (General Accounting Office 2003).
 The decision to apply post-fire treatments to reduce runoff and erosion is based on a risk analysis &ndash assessing
 the probability that damaging floods, erosion, and sedimentation will occur; the values that are at risk for damage;
 the need for reducing the risk of damage; and the magnitude of risk reduction that can reasonably be expected from
 mitigation treatments.

$Abstract=After the Valley Complex Fire burned 86 000 ha in western Montana in 2000,
 two studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log, straw wattle,
 and hand-dug contour trench erosion barriers in mitigating postfire runoff and erosion.
 Sixteen plots were located across a steep, severely burned slope, with a single barrier installed in 12 plots (four
 per treatment and four plots left untreated as controls.
 In a rainfall-plus-inflow simulation, 26 mm h<sup>-1</sup> rainfall was applied
 to each plot for 1 h and 48 L min <sup>-1</sup> of overland flow was added for the last 15 min.
 Total runoff from the contour-felled log
 (0.58 mm) and straw wattle (0.40 mm) plots was significantly less than from the control plots (2.0 mm), but the contour trench
 plots (1.3 mm) showed no difference.
 The total sediment yield from the straw wattle plots (0.12 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly
 less than the control plots (2.2Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>); the sediment yields in the contour-felled log plots
 (0.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 trench plots (2.5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 <br><br>
 After the simulations, sediment fences were installed to trap sediment eroded by natural rainfall. During the subsequent
 3 years, sediment yields from individual events increased significantly with increasing 10 min maximum intensity and rainfall
 amounts. High-intensity rainfall occurred early in the study and the erosion barriers were filled with sediment. There were no
 significant differences in event or annual sediment yields among treated and control plots. In 2001, the overall mean annual
 sediment yield was 21 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>; this value declined significantly to 0.6 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2002
 and 0.2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2003. The
 erosion barrier sediment storage used was less than the total available storage capacity; runoff and sediment were observed
 going over the top and around the ends of the barriers even when the barriers were less than half filled.

$Abstract=This study investigated the effect of cumulative overland flow on rill erodibility and
 critical shear stress on native surface roads in central Idaho. Rill erodibility decreased exponentially
 with increasing cumulative overland flow depth; however, critical shear stress did not change.
 The study demonstrated that road erodibility on the studied road changes over the course of one or more
 consecutive overland flow events. Therefore, model simulations that fail to take into consideration this
 change will probably over-estimate sediment yields. An exponential function describing the relationship
 between rill erodibility and cumulative overland flow depth is presented as a basis for future model
 development for simulating erosion on native surface roads.

$Abstract=An erosion control product made by shredding on-site woody materials was evaluated for mitigating erosion
 through a series of rainfall simulations.
 Tests were conducted on bare soil and soil with 30, 50, and 70% cover on a coarse and a fine-grained soil.
 Results indicated that the wood product known as wood shreds reduced runoff and soil loss from both soil types.
 Erosion mitigation ranged from 60 to nearly 100% depending on the soil type and amount of concentrated flow and
 wood shred cover.
 Wood shreds appear to be a viable alternative to agricultural straw. A wood shred cover of 50% appears optimal,
 but the appropriate coverage rate will depend on the amount of expected concentrated flow and soil type.

$Abstract=The concentrations of sediment and turbidity in stream water were monitored during culvert removals to determine the short term
effects of road obliteration. Sediment concentration was measured at 11 stream crossings among two locations in Idaho and one in
Washington. Sediment concentration immediately below the culvert outlet exceeded levels above the culvert outlet by at least three orders
of magnitude at all stream crossings. Sediment yields ranged from 170 to less than 1 kg in the 24-h period following culvert removal.
Turbidity exceeded the regulatory limits during culvert removal at all locations monitored in this study and remained above the limits
beyond the monitoring periods of 24 h at four of the locations. Sediment concentrations 100m downstream of the culvert outlet were
reduced by an order of magnitude, but did not change the turbidity values sufficiently to meet regulatory limits. Sediment concentrations
an average of 810m downstream of the culvert outlet were similar to sediment concentrations above the culvert for the entire excavation
period and turbidity regulations were met. Mitigation consisting of two straw bales placed in the stream caused a significant reduction in
sediment yield from an average of 67 kg to an average of 1.6 kg.

$Abstract=Between 1998 and 2002, six sites were established immediately after large wildfires in the western United
 States to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers in mitigating post-wildfire runoff and erosion.
 In each pair of matched, burned, and small watersheds (1.13 ha), one was treated with contour-felled log erosion barriers
 and one was left untreated as a control. For 4 to 6 post-fire years, runoff and sediment yields were measured and correlated
 with rain properties. High-intensity rainfall produced most of the measured runoff and sediment yields except in the
 southern California site, where long-duration rain events produced most of the runoff and erosion. For small rain events
 (less than the 2-year return period for the 10-min duration), the runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields were lower in
 the treated watersheds than in the control watersheds, but there was no treatment effect for rain events with larger return
 periods. Improper installation and degradation over time reduced the effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers.
 Rainfall characteristics and installation procedures should be carefully considered before choosing contour-felled log
 erosion barriers for post-fire hillslope stabilisation.

$Abstract=Meaningful relationships between forest structure attributes measured in representative field plots on the ground and remotely sensed data
 measured comprehensively across the same forested landscape facilitate the production of maps of forest attributes such as basal area (BA) and
 tree density (TD). Because imputation methods can efficiently predict multiple response variables simultaneously, they may be usefully applied to
 map several structural attributes at the species-level. We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated
 at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data.
 The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance,
 Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical
 Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF). To compare and evaluate these approaches, we
 computed a scaled Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between observed and imputed plot-level BA and TD for 11 conifer species sampled in
 north-central Idaho. We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most
 important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD. We concluded that RF was the most robust and flexible among the imputation methods
 we tested. We also concluded that canopy structure and topographic metrics derived from LiDAR surveys can be very useful for species-level
 imputation.

$Abstract=Millions of dollars are spent each year in the United States to mitigate the effects of wildfires and reduce the
 risk of flash floods and debris flows. Research from forested, chaparral, and rangeland communities indicate
 that severe wildfires can cause significant increases in soil water repellency resulting in increased runoff and
 erosion. Few data are available to document the effects of fire on the spatial and temporal variability in soil
 water repellency and potential impacts on infiltration and runoff on sagebrush-dominated landscapes. Soil
 water repellency, infiltration and runoff were assessed after two wildfires and one prescribed fire in three
 steep, sagebrush-dominated watersheds with coarse-textured soils. Water repellency was generally greater
 on unburned hillslopes and annual variability in water repellency had a greater impact on infiltration
 capacity than fire effects. The most significant impact of fire was canopy and ground cover removal on
 coppice microsites. Infiltration rates decreased on coppice microsites after fire even though soil water
 repellency was reduced. Fire-induced reduction in infiltration resulted from the combined effect of canopy
 and ground cover removal and the presence of naturally strong water repellent soils. Removal of ground
 cover likely increased the spatial connectivity of runoff areas from strongly water repellent soils. The results
 indicate that for coarse-textured sagebrush landscapes with high pre-fire soil water repellency, post-fire
 increases in runoff are more influenced by fire removal of ground and canopy cover than fire effects on soil
 water repellency and that the degree of these impacts may be significantly influenced by short-term
 fluctuations in water repellent soil conditions.

$Abstract=Post-fire runoff and erosion from wildlands has been well researched,
 but few studies have researched the degree of control
 exerted by fire on rangeland hydrology and erosion processes.
 Furthermore, the spatial continuity and temporal persistence
 of wildfire impacts on rangeland hydrology and erosion are not well understood.
 Small-plot rainfall and concentrated flow
 simulations were applied to unburned and severely burned hillslopes to determine the spatial continuity and persistence of
 fire-induced impacts on runoff and erosion by interrill and rill processes on steep sagebrush-dominated sites.
 Runoff and erosion were measured immediately following and each of 3 years post-wildfire.
 Spatial and temporal variability in post-fire hydrologic and erosional responses were compared with
 runoff and erosion measured under unburned conditions.
 Results from interrill simulations indicate fire-induced impacts were predominantly on coppice microsites
 and that fire influenced interrill sediment yield more than runoff.
 Interrill runoff was nearly unchanged by burning, but 3-year cumulative interrill sediment
 yield on burned hillslopes (50 g m<sup>-2</sup>) was twice that of unburned hillslopes
 (25 g m<sup>-2</sup>).
 The greatest impact of fire was on the dynamics of runoff once overland flow began.
 Reduced ground cover on burned hillslopes allowed overland flow to concentrate into rills.
 The 3-year cumulative runoff from concentrated flow simulations on burned hillslopes (298 l) was nearly 20 times
 that measured on unburned hillslopes (16 l).
 The 3-year cumulative sediment yield from concentrated flow on burned and
 unburned hillslopes was 20 400 g m<sup>-2</sup> and 6 g m<sup>-2</sup> respectively.
 Fire effects on runoff generation and sediment were greatly reduced, but remained, 3 years post-fire.
 The results indicate that the impacts of fire on runoff and erosion from severely
 burned steep sagebrush landscapes vary significantly by microsite and process,
 exhibiting seasonal fluctuation in degree, and
 that fire-induced increases in runoff and erosion may require more than 3 years to return to background levels.

$Abstract=A principal task of evaluating large wildfires is to assess fire's effect on the
 soil in order to predict the potential watershed response.
 Two types of soil water repellency tests, the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test and
 the mini-disk infiltrometer (MDI) test, were performed after the Hayman Fire in Colorado,
 in the summer of 2002 to assess the infiltration potential of the soil.
 Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery was also collected to map post-wildfire ground cover and soil condition.
 Detailed ground cover measurements were collected to validate the remotely sensed imagery and to examine the
 relationship between ground cover and soil water repellency.
 Percent ash cover measured on the ground was significantly correlated to WDPT (<i>r</i>=0.42; <i>p</i>-value&lt;0.0001),
 and the MDI test (<i>r</i>=-0.37; <i>p</i>-value&lt;0.0001).
 A Mixture Tuned Matched Filter (MTMF) spectral unmixing algorithm was applied to the hyperspectral imagery,
 which produced fractional cover maps of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation.
 The remotely sensed ash image had significant correlations to the water repellency tests,
 WDPT (<i>r</i>=0.24; <i>p</i>-value=0.001), and the MDI test (<i>r</i>=.0.21; <i>p</i>-value=0.005).
 An iterative threshold analysis was also applied to the ash and water repellency data to
 evaluate the relationship at increasingly higher levels of ash cover.
 Regression analysis between the means of grouped data: MDI time vs. ash cover data (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.75)
 and vs. Ash MTMF scores (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> =0.63) yielded significantly stronger relationships.
 From these results we found on-the-ground ash cover greater than 49% and remotely sensed ash cover greater than
 33% to be indicative of strongly water repellent soils.
 Combining these results with geostatistical analyses indicated a spatial autocorrelation range of 15 to 40&nbsp;m.
 Image pixels with high ash cover (&gt;33%), including pixels within 15 m of these pixel patches, were used to create a
 likelihood map of soil water repellency.
 This map is a good indicator of areas where soil experienced severe fire effects--areas that
 likely have strong water repellent soil conditions and higher potential for post-fire erosion.

$Abstract=This paper reports soil losses and observed sediment deposition for 16 randomly selected forest road sections
 in the National Forests of Alabama.
 Visible sediment deposition zones were tracked along the stormwater flow path to the most remote location as a means of
 quantifying soil loss from road sections.
 Volumes of sediment in deposition zones were determined by depth and deposition area measurements.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) was used to predict deposition in buffers and sediment
 leaving buffers from these forest road sections.
 WEPP estimates for these Coastal Plain sites were compared to measured sediment deposition from the forest road sections
 on the National Forests of Alabama.
 The applicability of WEPP to model these forest roads in the Coastal Plain of Alabama is evaluated with
 a model efficiency statistic using the observed field experiment data.
 The study found that of the 16 road segments analyzed, the average road segment length was 45 m,
 and the average quantity of sediment deposited onto the forest floor from road sections was 2300 kg.
 The WEPP: Road predictions were not significantly different from the observed sediment deposition.
 This research effort provides information to quantify the magnitude of soil erosion from typical Coastal Plain
 forest roads in the southern region of the U.S.
 The information reported is useful in soil erosion prediction models to validate predictions and create
 forest road management scenarios.

$Authors=Robichaud, Lewis, Ashmun

$Publisher=USFS RMRS
$Abstract=The Mini-disk Infiltrometer has been adapted for use as a field test of post-fire infiltration and soil water repellency.
 Although the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test is the common field test for soil water repellency, the Mini-disk
 Infiltrometer (MDI) test takes less time, is less subjective, and provides a relative infiltration rate. For each test, the porous base
 plate of the MDI is placed on the soil surface and the amount of water that passes into the soil in one minute is measured.
 <br><br>
 Thousands of paired WDPT and MDI tests were applied at burned sites throughout the western United States, and the data
 were significantly correlated (r = -0.64). A classification tree analysis was used to group the MDI test results into "degree
 of soil water repellency" categories (strong, weak, and none) that correspond to similar categories established for the WDPT
 test. Fire-induced soil water repellency has high spatial variability and requires a valid sampling method if the data are to be
 credible. The MDI test protocol and sampling method described in this Research Note were developed for post-fire assessment,
 and provide a practical evaluation of burned soil infiltration characteristics in a limited time.

$Abstract=Fire in sagebrush rangelands significantly alters canopy cover, ground cover, and soil properties which influence runoff and erosion processes.
Runoff can be generated more quickly and in larger volume following fire resulting in increased risk of severe erosion and downstream flooding.
The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was developed to predict erosion on cropland, forest, and rangeland. WEPP is a tool that has
potential to model the effect of fire on hillslope hydrological processes and help managers address erosion and runoff risks following fire.
Experimental results on a steep (35 to 50% slope) sagebrush site suggest that rill erosion is the dominant erosion process following fire and the
WEPP parameterization equations related to the rill erosion process need improvements. Rill detachment estimates could be improved by
modifying regression-estimated values of rill erodibility. Also, the interactions of rill width and surface roughness on soil shear stress estimates
may also need to be modified. In this paper we report the effects of prescribed fire on runoff, soil erosion, and rill hydraulics and compare WEPP
estimated erosion for several modeling options with measured erosion.

$Abstract=Woody biomass erosion control products are increasing in popularity as an alternative to agricultural straw
 in forested areas.
 Applications of two wood-based products, wood strands and wood shreds, plus agricultural straw were investigated in
 this study.
 All three investigated mitigation treatments significantly reduced soil loss during both the snowmelt and
 summer seasons on coarse-grained soil.
 Mitigation treatments did not significantly reduce soil loss from the fine-grained soil,
 although the untreated plot produced two to six times as much sediment as the treated plots.
 A significant amount of mitigation material was lost from the shreds and straw plots over the course of the first year.
 Wood strands maintained their original cover over this time period.
 All mitigation treatments reduced plant revegetation on the fine-grained soil;
 however, wood strands did not inhibit revegetation on the coarse-grained soil.

$Abstract=Forest roads are obliterated to lower the risks of surface erosion and mass failures.
 One purpose of the road obliteration is to return the compacted forest roads to productive pre-road conditions,
 i.e., a forest floor with high infiltration capacity, low interrill erodibility, and high vegetation ground cover.
 It is important to know how these characteristics recover following road obliteration.
 Infiltration capacity, interrill erodibility, and vegetation ground cover are essential parameters for
 modeling erosion from obliterated roads for erosion prediction models such as the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP).
 We chose three sites located on the Payette National Forest, Idaho.
 Rainfall simulations were conducted on 1&nbsp;�&nbsp;1&nbsp;m plots with three replications in two consecutive years.
 Three 30 min storm events with an intensity of 89 mm h<sup>-1</sup> were applied to each plot.
 Photos were taken to determine vegetation ground cover.
 Infiltration capacity and interrill erodibility in this study were determined as 9.0 mm h<sup>-1</sup>
 for saturated hydraulic conductivity and 3.2&nbsp;�&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> kg�s m<sup>-4</sup> for interrill erodibility.
 This study postulated a history of saturated hydraulic conductivity on a forest road from prior to road building
 to years after obliteration.
 The low elevation (1400&nbsp;m) site had vegetation ground cover of 27% after three years following road obliteration,
 while the other high elevation (1800&nbsp;m and 2200&nbsp;m) sites had 8% after four years.
 We conclude that four years was not sufficient time for obliterated roads to return to the pre-road (forest floor)
 conditions, especially for infiltration capacity.

$Abstract=After the Valley Complex Fire burned 86 000 ha in western Montana in 2000,
 two studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log, straw wattle,
 and hand-dug contour trench erosion barriers in mitigating postfire runoff and erosion.
 Sixteen plots were located across a steep, severely burned slope, with a single barrier installed in 12 plots (four
 per treatment and four plots left untreated as controls.
 In a rainfall-plus-inflow simulation, 26 mm h<sup>-1</sup> rainfall was applied
 to each plot for 1 h and 48 L min <sup>-1</sup> of overland flow was added for the last 15 min.
 Total runoff from the contour-felled log
 (0.58 mm) and straw wattle (0.40 mm) plots was significantly less than from the control plots (2.0 mm), but the contour trench
 plots (1.3 mm) showed no difference.
 The total sediment yield from the straw wattle plots (0.12 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly
 less than the control plots (2.2Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>); the sediment yields in the contour-felled log plots
 (0.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 trench plots (2.5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 <br><br>
 After the simulations, sediment fences were installed to trap sediment eroded by natural rainfall. During the subsequent
 3 years, sediment yields from individual events increased significantly with increasing 10 min maximum intensity and rainfall
 amounts. High-intensity rainfall occurred early in the study and the erosion barriers were filled with sediment. There were no
 significant differences in event or annual sediment yields among treated and control plots. In 2001, the overall mean annual
 sediment yield was 21 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>; this value declined significantly to 0.6 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2002
 and 0.2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2003. The
 erosion barrier sediment storage used was less than the total available storage capacity; runoff and sediment were observed
 going over the top and around the ends of the barriers even when the barriers were less than half filled.

$Abstract=Accelerated runoff and erosion commonly occur following forest fires due to combustion of protective forest floor material,
 which results in bare soil being exposed to overland flow and raindrop impact, as well as water repellent soil conditions.
 After the 2000 Valley Complex Fires in the Bitterroot National Forest of west-central Montana, four sets of six hillslope
 plots were established to measure first-year post-wildfire erosion rates on steep slopes (greater than 50%) that had burned
 with high severity. Silt fences were installed at the base of each plot to trap eroded sediment from a contributing area of
 100 m<sup>2</sup>.
 Rain gauges were installed to correlate rain event characteristics to the event sediment yield. After each sedimentproducing
 rain event, the collected sediment was removed from the silt fence and weighed on site, and a sub-sample taken to
 determine dry weight, particle size distribution, organic matter content, and nutrient content of the eroded material. Rainfall
 intensity was the only significant factor in determining post-fire erosion rates from individual storm events. Short duration, high
 intensity thunderstorms with a maximum 10-min rainfall intensity of 75 mm h<sup>-1</sup> caused the highest erosion rates (greater than
 20 t ha<sup>-1</sup>).
 Long duration, low intensity rains produced little erosion (less than 0.01 t ha<sup>-1</sup>).
 Total C and N in the collected
 sediment varied directly with the organic matter; because the collected sediment was mostly mineral soil, the C and N content
 was small. Minimal amounts of Mg, Ca, and K were detected in the eroded sediments. The mean annual erosion rate predicted
 by Disturbed WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) was 15% less than the mean annual erosion rate measured, which is
 within the accuracy range of the model.

$Abstract=The Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) and the U.S. Geological Survey
Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center produce Burned Area Reflectance
Classification (BARC) maps for use by Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams in rapid
response to wildfires. BAER teams desire maps indicative of fire effects on soils, but green and
nonphotosynthetic vegetation and other materials also affect the spectral properties of post-fire
imagery. Our objective was to assess how well satellite image-derived burn severity indices relate
to a suite of immediate post-fire effects measured on the ground. We measured or calculated fire
effects variables at 418 plots, nested in 50 field sites, located across the full range of burn severities
observed at the 2003 Black Mountain, Cooney Ridge, Robert, and Wedge Canyon wildfires in
western Montana, the 2003 Old and Simi wildfires in southern California, and the 2004 Porcupine
and Chicken wildfires in interior Alaska. We generated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR),
differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative dNBR (RdNBR), Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI), and differenced NDVI (dNDVI) burn severity indices from Landsat&nbsp;5
Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery across these eight wildfires. The NBR correlated best with the fire
effects measures but insignificantly, meaning other indices could act as suitable substitutes. The
overstory (trees in Montana and Alaska, shrubs in California) measures appear to correlate best to
the image variables, followed by understory and surface cover measures. Exposed mineral soil and
soil water repellency were poorly correlated with the image variables, while green vegetation was
most highly correlated. The BARC maps are more indicative of post-fire vegetation condition than
soil condition. We conclude that the NBR and dNBR, from which BARC maps of large wildfires
in the United States are currently derived, are sound choices for rapid assessment of immediate
post-fire burn severity across the three ecosystems sampled. Our future research will focus on
spectral mixture analysis (SMA) because it acknowledges that pixel refl ectance is fundamentally a
mixture of charred, dead, green and nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil, rock and ash materials that
are highly variable at fine scales.

$Abstract=Vegetation response and burn severity were examined following eight large wildfires that burned
in 2003 and 2004: two wildfires in California chaparral, two each in dry and moist mixed-conifer
forests in Montana, and two in boreal forests in interior Alaska. Our research objectives were: 1) to
characterize one year post-fire vegetation recovery relative to initial fire effects on the soil surface
that could potentially serve as indicators of vegetation response (and thus, ultimately longerterm
post-fire ecosystem recovery), and 2) to use a remotely-sensed indicator of burn severity to
describe landscape patterns in fire effects. We correlated one-year post-fire plant species richness
and percent canopy cover to burn severity and to soil surface cover immediately after the fires.
For all eight wildfires, plant canopy cover and species richness were low and highly variable
one year post-fire. We found a greater number of forbs when compared to other plant life forms,
independent of burn severity. Plant cover was dominated by grasses in chaparral systems, by forbs
in mixed-conifer forests, and by shrubs in boreal forests, similar to the unburned vegetation. Finescale
variability in post-fire effects on soils, the diversity of pre-fire vegetation, and the resilience
of plants to fire likely explain the high variation observed in post-fire vegetation responses across
sites and burn severities. On most low and moderate burn severity sites, &gt;30% of the soil surface
was covered with organic material immediately post-fire, and one year later, the canopy cover of
understory vegetation averaged 10% or more, suggesting low risk to post-fire erosion. In California
chaparral and the two Montana mixed conifer sites, 5% or less of the area within the fire perimeter
burned with high severity, while in Alaska, 58% was mapped as high burn severity; we think
this is characteristic in Alaska, but uncharacteristic of chaparral fires, especially given the high
proportion of non-native species post-fi re in our chaparral sites. All fi res had a mosaic of different
burn severities (as indicated by delta Normalized Burn Ratio, dNBR) with highly variable patch
size (mean 1.3 ha to 14.4 ha, range from &lt;1 ha to over 100,000 ha).

$Abstract=Wildfire effects on the ground surface are indicative of the potential for post-fire watershed erosion
response. Areas with remaining organic ground cover will likely experience less erosion than areas
of complete ground cover combustion or exposed mineral soil. The Simi and Old fires burned
~67,000 ha in southern California in 2003. Burn severity indices calculated from pre- and postfi
re multispectral imagery were differenced (i.e., differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR)) to
highlight fire-induced changes to soil and vegetation. Aerial and fi eld hyperspectral data were also
collected together with field ground cover measurements soon after the fires. Spectral endmembers
representing green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), charred NPV, and charred
and uncharred inorganic materials (soil, ash, and rock) were used in a constrained linear spectral
unmixing process to determine the post-fire fractional ground cover of each component on the
ground surface. The spectral unmixing results, dNBR, and a Relative dNBR (RdNBR) were
validated using field-measured fractional ground cover estimates to determine which product best
predicted the conditions on the ground. The spectral unmixing results were significantly correlated
to all classes of charred and uncharred organics and inorganics, and the dNBR was the best indicator
of charred soil and green vegetation. The RdNBR had several significant correlations with the
ground data, yet did not consistently correlate well with any specific ground cover types. A map
of post-wildfire ground cover and condition, especially exposed soil and remaining vegetative
cover, is a good indicator of the fire's effect on the ground surface and the resulting potential for
hydrologic response.

$Abstract=Wildfire is an important ecological process and management issue on western
 rangelands. Fire suppression activities in the past century have increased the number and
 severity of wildfires, resulting in increased soil erosion and decreased water quality. Many
 infiltration studies on rangeland have shown that litter and vegetation cover protect the soil
 and enhance infiltration. After fire, water repellency is typically found on the soil surface or a
 few centimeters below and is also common on unburned rangelands and dry soils conditions.
 However, the causal agents of water repellency are different for burned and burned
 conditions. Rainfall simulation studies were conducted for 3 consecutive years immediately
 following a catastrophic wildfire in Denio, Nevada, in 1999. Study sites were chosen on northfacing
 hillslopes (35 to 40 percent slope) where the vegetation was dominated by mountain
 big sagebrush (<i>Artemisia tridentata</i> ssp. <i>vaseyana</i>). The objective of this study was to use
 indirect gradient analysis on the 1999 data to evaluate and summarize pertinent relationships
 between vegetation, soil, topographic features, infiltration, runoff, sediment production, and
 microsite distinction (shrub coppice and interspace) on burned and unburned areas. The first
 ordination (strategy&nbsp;1) used four infiltration parameters and the results were unexpected. In
 the multivariate context, higher infiltration trends were associated with the burned treatment
 compared to the unburned treatment. Water repellency on the burned sites was apparent
 at the soil surface; however, it appears that repellency was also a significant factor on the
 unburned area. Water repellency in the unburned treatment was likely caused by assorted
 litter buildup (up to 11,605 kg/ha) in &gt; 80-year stands (sagebrush duff and grass in the shrub
 coppice areas and grass litter in the interspace). The second ordination (strategy&nbsp;2) involved
 the same four infiltration parameters, but specifically used plots from the burned treatment.
 More runoff and sediment was associated with the burn shrub coppice plots; in contrast,
 higher infiltration capacity in the burned interspace. The third ordination (strategy&nbsp;3) was
 based on plant canopy cover by species. Discrete taxa of native grasses, forbs, and shrubs
 were correlated with infiltration, runoff, and sediment loss on burned and unburned sites.
 On the unburned sites, water repellency and higher runoff was correlated with Sandberg
 bluegrass (<i>Poa secunda</i>), bluebunch wheatgrass (<i>Pseudoroegneria spicata</i>), and western
 aster (<i>Symphyotrichum ascendens</i>). Greater infiltration capacity was correlated with
 increasing cover of Idaho fescue (<i>Festuca idahoensis</i>) and mountain big sagebrush. Future
 analysis will evaluate conditions after the first years growing season and beyond.

$Abstract=Wildfire effects include loss of vegetative cover and changes to soil properties that
may lead to secondary effects of increased runoff, erosion, flooding, sedimentation,
and vulnerability to invasive weeds. These secondary effects may threaten
human life and safety, cultural and ecological resources, land use, and existing
infrastructure. Current Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessment
procedures require identification and valuation of values-at-risk (VAR) from the potential
secondary effects of wildfires. However, guidelines to estimate the monetary
value of these resources are limited and difficult to apply. This project examined
current methods for post-fire assessment of VAR and sought methodologies to
standardize and simplify the complex valuation task. A spreadsheet-based "VAR
Calculation Tool" supports this valuation framework. It is expected to improve defensibility
of VAR valuation and post-fire emergency treatment decisions.

$Abstract=Rapid Response Research is conducted during and immediately after wildland fires, in coordination with fire management teams, in order to collect information that can best be garnered in situ and in real-time.
 This information often includes fire behavior and fire effects data, which can be used to generate practical tools such as predictive fire models for managers.
 Drawing upon lessons learned from fire managers and researchers working on active wildland fires, we identify challenges including high costs, logistics, and safety; understanding and fitting into the fire management organization; building relationships with managers and other researchers; and science delivery.
 Our recommendations for safer and more effective Rapid Response Research are that researchers must understand the fire organizations and their objectives because a fire manager's primary responsibility is to manage the fire safely, not support research.
 In addition, researchers must be prepared with equipment, a "red card" signifying sufficient training and fitness, and appropriate knowledge when arriving to do research on a fire.
 Further, researchers must have and follow an operations plan.
 We recommend using a liaison to build strong relationships with managers and sharing what was learned.
 Science guided by questions that are important to managers is essential to improving both the understanding of wildland fire dynamics and developing strategies to address fire risk, rehabilitation, and restoration, yet researchers must be aware of the challenges of conducting research on active wildland fires.

$Abstract=After prescribed burns at three locations and one wildfire, rainfall simulations studies were completed
 to compare postfire runoff rates and sediment yields on ash-cap soil in conifer forest regions of northern
 Idaho and western Montana. The measured fire effects were differentiated by burn severity (unburned,
 low, moderate, and high).
 <br><br>
 Results indicate that this dry, undisturbed ash-cap soil exhibits high runoff rates and is naturally water
 repellent at the surface. However, the unburned, undisturbed ash-cap soil is not highly erodible due [to]
 the protective duff layer on the surface. When ash-cap soil was exposed to prolonged soil heating (high
 severity burn), surface water repellency was destroyed and a strong water repellent layer occurred a
 few centimeters beneath the soil surface. With the simulated rainfall, the non-water repellent surface
 layer became saturated; thus making the soil above the water repellent layer highly erodible&ndash;especially
 during high intensity rainfall.

$Abstract=Burn severity is mapped after wildfires to evaluate immediate and long-term fire effects on the landscape.
 Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide important information about fine-scale ground cover
 components that are indicative of burn severity after large wildland fires.
 Airborne hyperspectral imagery and ground data were collected after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado to assess the
 application of high resolution imagery for burn severity mapping and to compare it to standard burn severity
 mapping methods.
 Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), a partial spectral unmixing algorithm, was used to identify the spectral
 abundance of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation in the burned area.
 The overall performance of the MTMF for predicting the ground cover components was satisfactory
 (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.21 to 0.48) based on a comparison to fractional ash, soil, and vegetation cover
 measured on ground validation plots.
 The relationship between Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values and the ground data
 was also evaluated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.20 to 0.58) and found to be comparable to the MTMF.
 However, the quantitative information provided by the fine-scale hyperspectral imagery makes it possible to more
 accurately assess the effects of the fire on the soil surface by identifying discrete ground cover characteristics.
 These surface effects, especially soil and ash cover and the lack of any remaining vegetative cover,
 directly relate to potential postfire watershed response processes.

$Abstract=The decision of where, when, and how to apply the most effective postfire erosion mitigation treatments requires land managers to assess the
risk of damaging runoff and erosion events occurring after a fire. To meet this challenge, the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) was
developed. ERMiT is a web-based application that uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) technology to estimate erosion, in
probabilistic terms, on burned and recovering forest, range, and chaparral lands with and without the application of mitigation treatments. User
inputs are processed by ERMiT to combine rain event variability with spatial and temporal variabilities of hillslope burn severity and soil
properties, which are then used as WEPP input parameter values. Based on 20 to 40 individual WEPP runs, ERMiT produces a distribution of rain
event erosion rates with a probability of occurrence for each of five postfire years. In addition, rain event erosion rate distributions are generated
for postfire hillslopes that have been treated with seeding, straw mulch, and erosion barriers such as contour-felled logs or straw wattles.

   <b>Transactions in GIS</b> 10(3):395-415.
$Abstract=An empirical modeling of road related and non-road related landslide hazard for a large geographical area
 using logistic regression in tandem with signal detection theory is presented.
 This modeling was developed using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data,
 and was implemented on the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho.
 The approach is based on explicit and quantitative environmental correlations between observed
 landslide occurrences, climate, parent material, and environmental attributes while the receiver operating
 characteristic (ROC) curves are used as a measure of performance of a predictive rule.
 The modeling results suggest that development of two independent models for road related and non-road related
 landslide hazard was necessary because spatial prediction and predictor variables were different for these models.
 The probabilistic models of landslide potential may be used as a decision support tool in forest planning
 involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain.

Currently the preferred burn severity index is the delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), which
requires NBR values from both immediate post-fire and pre-fire Landsat images, the preferred
satellite image source. The objective was to compare NBR, dNBR, and other indices with
potential to indicate burn severity, using as the evaluation measure the correlation strength
between the burn severity indices (BSI) and post-fire effects (PFE) measured on the ground.

$Abstract=This article describes a prototype modeling system for assessing forest management-related erosion at its source
and predicting sediment transport from hillslopes to stream channels and through channel networks to a watershed outlet.
We demonstrate that it is possible to develop a land management tool capable of accurately assessing the primary impacts
of spatiotemporally varied forest management practices on sediment yield and delivery at hillslope to watershed scales in
a single simulation. The modeling system consists of four components: (1) the TOpographic ParameteriZation (TOPAZ) model
for discretizing hillslope and channel elements, (2) the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model for evaluating
hillslope-scale surface erosion processes, (3) the National Center for Computational Hydrodynamics and Engineering.s
one-dimensional (CCHE1D) hydrodynamic-sediment transport model, and (4) an interface program to manage relational
databases and data transfer between modules. The coupled models were calibrated and validated with observed flow and
sediment load data from the North Fork Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed in coastal northern California. The coupled
models. predictions of peak flow rate and total flow volume were not significantly different from observed values. Predicted
sediment concentrations were significantly different from observed values, but within typical ranges for sediment transport
equations. We recommend that the WEPP model be improved to allow access to sub-daily time scale results so that it can be
better integrated with other watershed models.

$Abstract=Space and airborne sensors have been used to map area burned, assess characteristics of active fires, and
 characterize post-fire ecological effects. Confusion about fire intensity, fire severity, burn severity, and related terms
 can result in the potential misuse of the inferred information by land managers and remote sensing practitioners
 who require unambiguous remote sensing products for fire management. The objective of the present paper is to
 provide a comprehensive review of current and potential remote sensing methods used to assess fire behavior and
 effects and ecological responses to fire. We clarify the terminology to facilitate development and interpretation
 of comprehensible and defensible remote sensing products, present the potential and limitations of a variety of
 approaches for remotely measuring active fires and their post-fire ecological effects, and discuss challenges and
 future directions of fire-related remote sensing research.

$Abstract=Scientists are tasked with seeing their science applied, and, in turn, managers rely on the objectiveness of scientists
to make defensible decisions. Scientists and managers currently use remote sensing to map, understand, and predict
the ecological effects of fire. Although much has been learned, challenges remain; and there is an urgent need to
provide science and tools that managers can use to address challenging fire management issues. In order to provide
such data and products, scientists must understand the needs and expectations of fire managers. To facilitate
bridging this gap between science and application, we brought together an expert panel of both researchers and
managers to discuss information needs and challenges and to make recommendations for the mapping of active fire
characteristics and post-fire effects. This paper provides a summary of this panel discussion, which highlighted
challenges relating to terminology, interpretation, data availability, etc; and suggested recommendations for
partnerships and strategies to address these challenges.

$Abstract=The effects of a wildfire on the ground surface are indicative of the potential for post-fire watershed response.
 Areas with remaining organic ground cover (green, uncharred, or charred) will likely experience less erosion than areas of
 complete ground cover combustion (ash) or exposed mineral soil, and may not need post-fire rehabilitation
 treatments. We collected aerial and field hyperspectral data together with field ground cover measurements after the
 2003 Simi Fire in southern California in order to create a map of the remaining ground surface components. Spectral
 endmembers representing green vegetation, charred vegetation, charred soil, and uncharred soil were used in a
 constrained linear spectral unmixing process to determine the post-fire fractional ground cover of each surface
 component. Significant correlations (<i>r</i> &gt; 0.2, <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.0001) were found between the fractional cover interpreted
 from hyperspectral images and corresponding field measurements indicating that these methods are appropriate for
 mapping post-fire ground conditions.

$Abstract=The recent modification of WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) has improved the
original model.s applicability to hydrology and erosion modeling in forest watersheds. To generate
reliable topographic and hydrologic inputs for the WEPP model, carefully selecting Digital Elevation
Models (DEMs) with appropriate resolution and accuracy is essential because topography is a major
factor controlling water erosion. LIght Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), a new remote sensing
technology, provides an alternative for generating fine and high-quality DEMs. This study applies
WEPP (v2006.201) for hydrological and erosion simulation under forest conditions and evaluates the
effects of DEM resolution and accuracy on watershed hydrology and water erosion prediction at a
watershed scale. Stream flow and total suspended solids (TSS) in two small forest watersheds
located in northern Idaho were collected and processed. A total of six DEMs from three sources
(NED, SRTM, and LiDAR) at three resolutions (30 m, 10 m, and 4 m) were obtained and used to
calculate topographic parameters as inputs to the WEPP model. WEPP-simulated hydrologic and
erosion results using the six DEMs were compared with the field-observed data. For both study
watersheds, DEMs with different resolutions and sources generated varied topographic and
hydrologic attributes, which in turn led to significantly different erosion predictions by WEPP.

$Abstract=Adequate and reliable erosion prediction tools are needed for sound forest resources management.
 Numerous watershed models have been developed during the past.
 These models, however, are often limited in their applications largely due to their inappropriate representations
 of the hydrological processes involved.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has demonstrated its usefulness in certain forest applications,
 such as modeling erosion from a segment of in-sloped or out-sloped road, and harvested or burned units.
 Nevertheless, when used for modeling water flow and sediment discharge from a forest watershed of
 complex topography and channel systems, WEPP consistently underestimates these quantities, in particular,
 the water flow at the watershed outlet.
 <br><br>
 The goal of this study was to improve the WEPP model such that it can be applied to adequately simulate
 forest watershed hydrology and erosion.
 Specific objectives were to:
  (1) identify and correct WEPP algorithms that inappropriately represent forest hydrologic processes; and
  (2) verify the modified model.
 Substantial changes were made in the approach to, and algorithms for modeling percolation of soil water and
 subsurface lateral flow in WEPP.
 The modified codes were subsequently applied to Hermada watershed,
 a small watershed located in the Boise National Forest in northern Idaho.
 The modeling results were compared with those obtained by using the original WEPP and the field-observed
 runoff and erosion data.
 Conclusions of this study include:
  (1) compared to the original model, the modified WEPP more realistically and properly represents the hydrologic processes
      in a forest setting; and
  (2) application of the modified model produced satisfactory results,
      demonstrating the adequacy of the model modifications.

$Abstract=Wind erosion is a widespread problem in much of the western United States due to arid
 conditions and persistent winds. Fugitive dust from eroding land poses a risk to both environmental
 quality and human health. Since the advent of the Clean Air Act in 1971, ambient air quality
 standards have been set regulating particulate matter in the atmosphere. Agricultural straw has
 been widely used for erosion control, but there are numerous drawbacks to its use. In addition to the
 fact that it is a lightweight material and lacks stability during high wind events, there is growing
 concern over the introduction of noxious weeds to wildlands, chemical residues from pesticides, and
 risks associated with dust particles liberated from the shattering of straw elements during the
 application process. The efficacy of a wood strand material, a wood analog to straw, for wind
 erosion mitigation was investigated during this study. A series of wind tunnel tests were conducted
 to evaluate material properties of wood strands in terms of reducing total sediment loss and
 maintaining air quality. Results indicate that wood strands are stable at wind speeds of up to 18 m/s,
 while wheat straw is only stable at wind speeds of up to 6.5 m/s. At a wind velocity of 18 m/s, the
 straw, due to its instability, did not reduce soil loss; however, wood strands reduced total sediment
 loss and peak dust emissions by over 90% when compared to a bare soil.

$Abstract=Erosion in the first year after a wildfire can be up to three orders of magnitude greater than
the erosion from undisturbed forests. To mitigate potential postfire erosion, various erosion control
treatments are applied on highly erodible areas with downstream resources in need of protection.
Because postfire erosion rates generally decline by an order of magnitude for each year of recovery,
effective erosion mitigation treatments are most needed during the first year or two after a fire.
Postfire treatments include broadcast seeding, scarification and trenching, physical erosion barriers
such as contour-felled logs and straw wattles, and mulching with wheat straw, wood straw, and
hydromulch. This paper summarizes data from more than seven years of studies to evaluate the
effectiveness of postfire erosion mitigation treatments at the hillslope and small watershed-scale in
the western U.S. Results suggest that some mitigation treatments may help reduce erosion for
some, but not all, rainfall events. Generally, mulching is more effective than seeding, scarifying, or
erosion barriers. For small rainfall events, reduction in first year erosion rates have been measured
for engineered wood straw and straw mulch (60 to 80%), contour-felled log erosion barriers (50 to
70%), and hydromulch (19%). Grass seeding treatments have little effect on first year erosion
reduction. For intense rain events (I10 greater than 40 mm h<sup>-1</sup>) there was little difference between
treated and non-treated areas.

$Abstract=Erosion following wildfire can be as much as 1000 times the erosion from an undisturbed forest.
  In August, 2005, the largest fire in the lower 48 states occurred in the Umatilla National Forest in Southeast Washington.
  Researchers from the Rocky Mountain Research Station assisted the forest in estimating soil erosion using three different
  applications of the WEPP model.
  GeoWEPP was used to determine the onsite distribution of soil erosion.
  WEPP Windows Watershed Version was used to estimate peak runoff rates of each of the ten small watersheds analyzed.
  The ERMiT interface to WEPP was used to estimate the probability of erosion amounts on selected hillslopes,
  and the benefits of mulching those slopes.
  Within the three days available for analysis, about 38 percent of the burned area was analyzed.
  This paper summarizes the analytical methods, and the findings of the prediction runs.

$Abstract=Sediment budget analyses require watershed scale evaluation of road erosion and delivery.
 The Watershed Erosion Prediction (WEPP) model, as developed by the USDA Forest Service,
 simulates sediment detachment and delivery for a road, fill, and buffer system.
 Time and budget constraints typically prevent a comprehensive sediment loading analysis using WEPP throughout a watershed.
 We present an automated approach to run the hillslope version of WEPP to simulate sediment detachment and delivery
 for a large road network.
 Road attributes are acquired from global positioning system-assisted road surveys and mapped in a geographic information
 system (GIS).
 After data manipulation in GIS and Excel, the required input files for WEPP are built.
 The approach can be applied to multiple road designs and climate regimes, with unique attributes for each road segment.
 We applied the automated approach to the 3,040 km<sup>2</sup> South Fork Clearwater River watershed for
 1,017 km of road divided into 6,955 road segments.
 The availability of analysis capabilities of the WEPP results from large road networks within GIS provides a
 spatially explicit tool for the management and evaluation of sediment production throughout large road networks.

$Abstract=The US Forest Service has identified unmanaged all terrain vehicle (ATV) use as a threat
to forested lands and grasslands. Some undesirable impacts include severely eroded soils, user-created
unplanned roads, disrupted wetland ecosystems, as well as general habitat destruction and
degraded water quality throughout forested lands. A study was conducted by the Rocky Mountain
Research Station and the San Dimas Technology Development Center to evaluate ATV impacts.
Trails were classified into one of three disturbances classes of low, medium, and high, based on loss
of litter and vegetation, trail width, and depth of wheel ruts. Following trail condition assessment,
rainfall simulations were conducted to measure erosion parameters on each of the three disturbance
classes. While infiltration parameters decreased with increased levels of ATV traffic, there was no
statistically significant difference among the three classification levels. There was, however,
generally a significant difference between undisturbed and the combined disturbed conditions.
Similar significant differences existed for interrill erosion. In all cases sediment loss would be
expected to increase due to ATV traffic. Information acquired from this study will be used to estimate
ATV traffic induced erosion and assist in the managing of ATV use.

$abstract=Two blends of manufactured wood strands with different lengths were tested for
effectiveness in controlling erosion. Wood strand blends were tested on two soils, two slopes,
and at three coverage amounts. Laboratory rainfall simulations were conducted to evaluate
runoff and sediment loss. Wood strands were effective in delaying runoff, reducing runoff
volume, and reducing sediment loss. There was no statistically significant difference between
the two wood strand blends with respect to runoff or sediment loss. In comparison to bare soil
with no cover, sediment loss was reduced by at least 70 percent for all cover amounts tested and
among each soil type, slope and flow event. In comparison to estimates of sediment loss
reductions due to agricultural straw (Burroughs and King, 1989), wood strand materials were
equally effective on coarse grained soils and superior to straw on fine grained soils. In contrast
to agricultural straw, manufactured wood strands are inherently weed and pesticide free.
Consequently, wood-based materials may be a more appropriate material for erosion mitigation,
especially in areas where introduction of non-native species is of great concern.

$Abstract=An important element of evaluating a large wildfire is to assess its effects on the soil in order to predict
 the potential watershed response.
 After the 55 000 ha Hayman Fire on the Colorado Front Range,
 24 soil and vegetation variables were measured to determine the key variables that could be used for a
 rapid field assessment of burn severity.
 The percentage of exposed mineral soil and litter cover proved to be the best predictors of burn severity in this environment.
 Two burn severity classifications, one from a statistical classification tree and the other a
 Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) burn severity map, were compared with measured ground truth burn severity at
 183 plots and were 56% and 69% accurate, respectively.
 <br><br>
 This study also compared water repellency measurements made with the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test
 and a mini-disk infiltrometer (MDI) test.
 At the soil surface, the moderate and highly burned sites had the strongest water repellency,
 yet were not significantly different from each other.
 Areas burned at moderate severity had 1.5 times more plots that were strongly water repellent at the surface than
 the areas burned at high severity.
 However, the high severity plots most likely had a deeper water repellent layer that was not detected
 with our surface tests.
 The WDPT and MDI values had an overall correlation of <i>r</i> = -0.64(<i>p</i> < 0.0001)
 and appeared to be compatible methods for assessing soil water repellency in the field.
 Both tests represent point measurements of a soil characteristic that has large spatial variability;
 hence, results from both tests reflect that variability, accounting for much of the remaining variance.
 The MDI is easier to use, takes about 1 min to assess a strongly water repellent soil and provides two indicators of
 water repellency: the time to start of infiltration and a relative infiltration rate.

$Publisher=European Geosciences Union
$Abstract=Measuring and modeling erosion after disturbances, such as prescribed fire and wild-fire,
has been a major research focus for the past 15 years. Fire-induced changes in-clude
increased erosion due to loss of the protective forest floor layer, loss of soil
water storage, and in some cases, creation of water repellent soil conditions. These
conditions increase the potential for flooding, debris flows, and sedimentation, which
are of special concern to people who live and mange resources in the areas adjacent to
burned areas. A web-based erosion risk management tool, ERMiT, has been developed
to predict erosion from postfire hillslopes and to evaluate the potential effectiveness
of various erosion mitigation practices. The model uses a probabilistic approach that
incorporates variability in climate, soil properties, and burn severity for forests, range-land,
and chaparral hillslopes. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) engine
is used in a Monte Carlo simulation mode to provide erosion rate probabilities. The
one-page custom interface is targeted to hydrologists and soil scientists and allows
the user to select climate, soil texture, burn severity, and hillslope topography.
For a given hillslope, the model uses a single 100-year run to obtain climate variability and
twenty 4 to 8 year runs to incorporate soil property and spatial burn severity variability.
The output, in both tabular and graphical form, relates the probability of soil erosion
exceeding a given amount in each of the first four years following the fire. Event
statistics are provided to show the magnitude and rainfall intensity of the storms used
to predict erosion rates. ERMiT also allows users to compare the effects of various
mitigation treatments (mulches, seeding, and barrier treatments such as contour-felled
logs or straw wattles) on erosion. Data to populate ERMiT was obtained using rainfall
simulation and concentrated flow (rill) techniques to obtain infiltration and erodibility
parameters for a variety of burn severities, soil textures and rehabilitation treatments
(straw mulch, hydromulch, contour-felled logs, straw wattles). Model validation ef-forts
are ongoing at nine paired watershed sites around the western United States.

$Abstract=The increasing size and severity of wildfires in the western United States has caused a corresponding increase in
 post-fire emergency erosion control activities.
 Hillslope treatments, such as broadcast seeding, mulching and installed barriers, are applied to reduce runoff and erosion,
 as well as downslope sedimentation. However, there are few data to determine if these post-fire treatments are practical
 and effective.
 Direct measurement of hillslope erosion, particularly in the remote settings where wildfires occur,
 is time consuming and costly.
 Rainfall simulation, sediment fences and paired catchment studies have been adapted for measuring post-fire erosion
 in the mountainous forest regions of the western USA.
 The use of paired catchments to measure hillslope erosion and evaluate treatment effectiveness is illustrated by
 an ongoing experiment of six contour-felled log erosion barrier research sites.
 Deciding which type of treatments to use, as well as the locations and timing of application,
 requires treatment cost and effectiveness to be weighed against potential damage from unmitigated erosion.
 To assist in this process, a web-based Erosion Risk Management Tool has been developed that incorporates
 variability in rainfall, burn severity and soil properties, as well as treatment options to provide probabilistic erosion
 estimates for 4 years after a fire.

$Title=Evaluation of runoff prediction from WEPP-based erosion models for harvested and burned forest watersheds
$Year=2005
$Authors=Covert, Robichaud, Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASAE
$Abstract=This study evaluates runoff predictions generated by GeoWEPP (Geo-spatial interface to the Water Erosion
 Prediction Project) and a modified version of WEPP v98.4 for forest soils. Three small (2 to 9 ha) watersheds in the mountains
 of the interior Northwest were monitored for several years following timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed climate
 variables, percent ground cover, soil erodibility values, and GIS-derived slope data were used to drive the models. Predictions
 of total yearly runoff generated by GeoWEPP (WEPP v2002.7) and the modified WEPP model were compared to total yearly
 runoff measured at each watershed. In addition, measured seasonal values were compared to the predictions generated by
 the modified WEPP model. GeoWEPP significantly underpredicted the total yearly runoff for all three sites. The modified
 WEPP model, with algorithm changes to account for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow, predicted total yearly
 runoff for two of the three sites with an index of agreement (d) of 0.8 and 0.9 for each. The third site performed less accurately,
 with d = 0.3. In the seasonal runoff predictions, the modified WEPP model was most accurate for the spring months (higher
 runoff) but was a poor predictor for other seasons when the measured runoff rates were low. The GeoWEPP model successfully
 incorporates digital elevation data, but the WEPP version used to process the data does not adequately represent the
 hydrological processes of forests. The lateral flow modifications that were added to the WEPP model improved predictions
 of runoff in forests, thus suggesting that further refinement of these calculations may improve the accuracy of WEPP-based
 models when applied to forest environments.

$Abstract=The US Forest Service has identified unmanaged all terrain vehicle (ATV) use as a threat to
 forested lands and grasslands. Some undesirable impacts include severely eroded soils, user-created
 unplanned roads, disrupted wetland ecosystems, as well as general habitat destruction
 and degraded water quality throughout forested lands. More insight on how ATV use affects
 trails is needed in order to make management decisions concerning ATV use on National Forest
 lands. Factors which may determine impacts of ATVs include site characteristics, such as soil
 moisture, soil types, existing terrain, and storm events, and ATV attributes such as vehicle type,
 tire tread, amount of trail use, and rider attitude.

$Title=Postfire rehabilitation treatments: are we learning what works?
$Year=2005
$Authors=Robichaud, Brown
$category=
$Publisher=ASCE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Major concerns after wildfires are the increased erosion and flooding potential
 due to loss of the protective forest floor layer, loss of water storage, and the creation
 of water repellent soil conditions. Treatments to mitigate postfire erosion and runoff
 are commonly applied on highly erodible areas; however the effectiveness of these
 treatments has had limited scientific evaluation. In recent years postfire hillslope
 treatment effectiveness has been evaluated by using sediment fences and small
 catchments to directly measure sediment yields from burned hillslopes and relate
 those results to the specific rain events that caused them. In addition, the erosion from
 areas treated with various rehabilitation treatments (seeding, mulching, erosion
 barriers, etc.) is compared to non-treated areas. Although many of these studies are
 still in progress, preliminary results suggest that some mitigation treatments may help
 reduce erosion for some, but not all, rain events. Immediately after installation,
 contour-felled log erosion barriers can reduce erosion up to 70% for small rain
 events. For high intensity rain events (10-min max intensity of 40 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> or greater)
 there little difference in erosion reduction between treated and non-treated areas.
 Other studies suggest that the natural mulch provided by dead conifer needles in areas
 of low and moderate burn severity can reduce rill erosion by 30 to 40% and interrill
 erosion by 50 to 70%.

$Title=Predicting cumulative watershed effects of fuel management with improved WEPP technology
$Year=2005
$Authors=Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASCE
$Abstract=The increase in severe wildfires in recent years is due in part to an abundance
 of fuels in forests. In an effort to protect values at risk, and decrease the severity of
 wildfires, forest managers have embarked on a major program of fuel reduction. Past 
 research has shown that such fuel reduction may have minimal impact at a hillslope
 scale, but when numerous hillsides are disturbed within a watershed over a number of
 years, the cumulative effect of such disturbances may be unacceptable. In addition,
 road networks are necessary to support fuel management activities by providing
 access for thinning crews, small diameter timber extraction, and fire crews. These
 road networks were frequently designed and constructed to minimize cost, and do not
 necessarily minimize adverse watershed impacts. Research findings from wildfire,
 fuel management, and roads will be presented to provide a context for predictive
 modeling. There are some new predictive tools to aid in watershed analysis. These
 include the GeoWEPP GIS wizard, the online WEPP:Road Batch processor and
 WEPP FuMe fuel management analysis tools, and a revised WEPP hillslope model
 with improved water balance and lateral flow capabilities. In this paper, we use these
 new technologies to explore the sources of sediment and runoff within a typical
 forested watershed. The paper shows improvements in runoff prediction with the
 revised WEPP model, as well as the relative importance of roads, wildfire, prescribed
 fire, and thinning operations in generating sediment at the hillslope and watershed
 scales. The analysis of the performance of the modified WEPP interface showed that
 there are problems within the WEPP Watershed stream flow routing routines that will
 need to be addressed before use of this modified model can be recommended.

$Abstract=Preliminary results are presented from ongoing research on spatial variability of fire effects on soils and vegetation
 from the Black Mountain Two and Cooney Ridge wildfires, which burned in western Montana during the 2003 fire
 season. Extensive field fractional cover data were sampled to assess the efficacy of quantitative satellite image-derived
 indicators of burn severity. The objective of this study was to compare the field burn severity measures to the digital
 numbers used to produce Burned Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) maps. Canopy density was the field variable
 most highly correlated to BARC data derived from either SPOT Multispectral (XS) or Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)
 imagery. Among the other field variables, old litter depth and duff depth correlated better with the satellite data than
 did old litter cover. Ash cover correlated most poorly. Old litter cover correlated better with the satellite data than did
 exposed mineral soil or rock cover, but combining the mineral soil and rock cover fractions into a single inorganic
 cover fraction improved the correlation to a comparable level. Most field variables, with the notable exception of ash,
 tended to vary more at low and moderate severity sites than at high severity sites. Semivariograms of the field variables
 revealed spatial autocorrelation across the spatial scales sampled (2 &ndash; 130 m), which the 20 m or 30 m resolution
 satellite imagery only weakly detected. Future analyses will be broadened to quantify burn severity characteristics in
 other forest types and to consider erosion processes, such as soil water infiltration following fire.

$Abstract=Agricultural straw is used in forested areas of the United States for
  erosion control on burned areas, harvest landings, decommissioned road prisms,
  road cuts and fills, and other areas of disturbed soil.
  Two blends of wood strands were statistically equal to straw in
  reducing both runoff and sediment production.
  Both the straw and each of the wood fiber mixes reduced erosion by 98 percent
  as compared to the bare soil.
  This result implies that wood fibers are an acceptable alternative to
  agricultural straw in erosion control applications.
  Further work is underway to determine optimum width and length mixes,
  application rates, and decomposition rates for the wood fibers.

 Remote Sensing Applications Center Project Report RSAC-0068-RPT1.
 Salt Lake City, UT: US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Remote Sensing Application Center. 29&nbsp;p.
$Abstract=The objectives of this project were to assess the potential of hyperspectral data to determine
 burn severity after wildfires and evaluate if the high spectral information makes it possible to
 detect water-repellency conditions of the soil. A burn-severity map helps prioritize
 rehabilitation efforts after a fire, reducing subsequent soil erosion and other problems.
 Generating such a classification requires developing a methodology to analyze the data and
 compiling a library containing spectra of burn-related materials.
 <br><br>
 Existing burn-severity classifications based on multispectral broadband remote sensing data 
 have a few drawbacks that using higher spectral and spatial data can help solve. To analyze
 this more detailed information, two types of field data were collected in selected locations:
 plot data related to water repellency and burn severity, as well as field spectrometer data
 about surface materials that could be related to the image spectra.
 <br><br>
 The imagery data were analyzed using two methods. One method selects two bands of the
 short-wave infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum to generate a simple ratio. This
 method is analogous to the normalized burn ratio that currently classifies broadband
 multispectral data but makes use of the additional narrow bands available in hyperspectral
 imagery, making it easier to target the wavelength used in the analysis. The second method,
 based on the mixture-tuned, matched-filtering algorithm, is a more traditional hyperspectral
 technique. The spectra comprising the signal present in a pixel are unmixed based on .pure.
 end-member spectra generated from material present on the surface.
 <br><br>
 The ratio method has the advantage of delivering results fairly fast compared to the second
 method because there is less need to preprocess the data accurately. However, just as the
 multispectral ratio does, this method produces a result for every pixel in the image whether it
 is related to the burn or not. The unmixing method results in less false positives and relates
 the classification of the data to materials present on the ground. Unmixing the data is,
 however, time consuming and very sensitive to preprocessing procedures such as
 atmospheric correction.
 <br><br>
 Relating the spectra to soil water-repellency conditions needs additional research. The
 orthorectification of the imagery was too coarse for accurate correlation with field data. But
 even with better rectification, this problem may be hard to solve. Determining water-repellency
 conditions often requires access to the soil just below the surface. Since visible
 and near-infrared wavelengths cannot penetrate the soil particles, remote sensing may not be
 the right tool. In locations where the fire has not burned the canopy, soil conditions cannot
 be assessed at all.

$Abstract=Forest fires may induce changes in soil organic properties that often lead to water repellent conditions within the soil
 profile that decrease soil infiltration capacity. The remote detection of water repellent soils after forest fires would
 lead to quicker and more accurate assessment of erosion potential. An airborne hyperspectral image was acquired
 over the Hayman Fire in the summer of 2002. A supervised classification was performed in an attempt to identify
 soils that were highly water repellent. The classification was not accurate in determining water repellency severity,
 but it was nearly 80 percent accurate for identifying the presence of surface water repellency. According to the
 classified image, nearly 20 percent of the Hayman Fire had water repellent soils.

$Abstract=The USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) and the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) produce Burned
 Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) maps for use by Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams in
 rapid response to wildfires. BAER teams desire maps indicative of soil burn severity, but photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic
 vegetation also influences the spectral properties of post-fire imagery. Our objective was to assess
 burn severity both remotely and on the ground at six 2003 wildfires. We analyzed fire-effects data from 34 field
 sites located across the full range of burn severities observed at the Black Mountain Two, Cooney Ridge, Robert,
 and Wedge Canyon wildfires in western Montana and the Old and Simi wildfires in southern California. We
 generated Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Normalized Difference
 Vegetation Index (NDVI) indices from Landsat 5, SPOT 4, ASTER, MASTER and MODIS imagery. Pearson
 correlations between the 44 image and 79 field variables having an absolute value greater than 0.5 were judged
 meaningful and tabulated in overstory, understory, surface cover, and soil infiltration categories. Vegetation
 variables produced a higher proportion of meaningful correlations than did surface cover variables, and soil
 infiltration variables the lowest proportion of meaningful correlations. Soil properties had little measurable
 influence on NBR, dNBR or NDVI, particularly in low and moderate severity burn areas where unconsumed
 vegetation occludes background reflectance. BAER teams should consider BARC products much more indicative of
 post-fire vegetation condition than soil condition. Image acquisition date, in relation to time of field data collection
 and time since fire, appears to be more important than type of imagery or index used. We recommend preserving
 the raw NBR or dNBR values in an archived map product to enable remote monitoring of post-fire vegetation
 recovery. We further recommend that BAER teams rely on the continuous BARC-Adjustable (BARC-A) product
 (and assign their own severity thresholds as needed) more than the classified BARC product, which oversimplifies
 highly heterogeneous burn severity characteristics on the ground.

$Abstract=This study assesses the accuracy of GeoWEPP model (Geospatial Water Erosion

 watersheds (2-9 ha) in the Interior Northwest were monitored for several years following
 timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed site factors of climate variables, percent
 ground cover and soil erodibility values, along with digital slope data were used to drive
 the models. The GeoWEPP and WEPP model predictions of runoff and sediment yield
 were compared to observed yearly totals from each watershed. Monthly totals were also
 compared the results of the modified version of WEPP. The yearly results showed that
 GeoWEPP under-predicts runoff and sediment and the results were not acceptable at a 90
 percent confidence interval. The same data was tested with the modified version of
 WEPP containing modified algorithms for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow
 intended to better represent forest hydrology. This modified version of the WEPP model
 showed improvements to yearly predictions of runoff and sediment over the GeoWEPP
 model and generated acceptable results of runoff and sediment. Monthly values of runoff
 and sediment yield generated by the modified WEPP generated acceptable results
 compared to the observed monthly values. The GeoWEPP model has the potential to
 model erosion with the incorporation of digital elevation data, but lacks the ability to
 accurately represent forest hydrology. The incorporation of a WEPP algorithm that
 represent forest soils more realistically would improve the results of GeoWEPP
 predictions.

$Abstract=The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) is a physically based erosion model
 for applications to dryland and irrigated agriculture, rangeland, and forests.
 U.S. Forest Service (USFS) experience showed that WEPP was not being adopted because
 of the difficulty in building files describing the input conditions in the existing interfaces.
 To address this difficulty, a suite of Internet interfaces with a database was developed to
 more easily predict soil erosion for a wide range of climatic and forest conditions,
 including roads, fires, and timber harvest.
 The database included a much larger climate database than was previously available
 for applications in remote forest and rangeland areas.
 Validation results showed reasonable agreement between erosion values reported in the
 literature and values predicted by the interfaces to the WEPP model.

$Abstract=Increased runoff and erosion commonly occur after wildfires with the onset of precipitation events. Various
 erosion mitigation treatments are often used after wildfires to reduce flooding and sedimentation. The
 effectiveness of these treatments has not been well documented in the literature; therefore we undertook a
 rapid response approach (within four weeks following fire suppression) to install small catchment monitoring
 systems to compare treatment effectiveness. A paired watershed approach uses two adjacent and similar
 catchments (5-20 ac) after wildfires, treating one catchment and using the other catchment as a control.
 We developed a rapid response monitoring system that can be installed in a few weeks to monitor sediment
 yield and runoff response. These systems are usually left in place for three to five years.
 <br><br>
 Each installation has a complete weather station and electronic measuring devices to record streamflow and
 sediment accumulation in a storage basin. Thesediment basins are cleaned out manually after each
 storm event in order to relate the event (intensity, amount and duration) to runoff and sediment yield.
 The data is automatically transmitted each day via cell phone or radio transmission to our computer server,
 thus making the data available daily on our web page. We have installed six paired catchments to date in
 Colorado, Washington, two in California, and two in Montana. Preliminary results suggest that 1) first year
 storm events produce the largest runoff and sediment response and 2) treatment effectiveness is less with
 high intensity short duration storm events. This rapid response protocol allows for quick installation of a
 monitoring system to provide an assessment of treatment effectiveness.

$Title=Modification of the evapotranspiration routines in the WEPP model: part 1.
$Year=2003
$Authors=Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASAE
$Abstract=The physical processes of evaporation and transpiration, collectively termed
 evapotranspiration, are discussed with respect to the unique conditions specific to forested
 environments. Forests have significant variations in ET rates due to 1) diurnal, seasonal, and annual
 climatic fluctuations; 2) spatiotemporal differences in vegetation; 3) evaporation of precipitation
 intercepted by vegetation, litter, and soil; 4) evaporation from water bodies; and 5) physiographic
 differences. The earliest methods for computing ET relied on empirical relations between climatic
 variables and consumptive water use by crops. Later formulations derived potential evaporation by
 relating solar radiation and temperature to the physical process of latent and sensible heat flux. To
 generalize Penman.s equation for crops that were water-stressed, Monteith incorporated a canopy
 resistance term to describe the effect that partially closed stomates have on evapotranspiration.
 Later researchers have modified these equations to account for variable crop density, rainfall
 interception, bare-soil evaporation, and multiple canopy layers. WEPP primarily uses a modification
 of Ritchie's method to compute ET. Although WEPP gives the user the option to use either
 Penman's, Priestly-Taylor's, Hargraves', or Penman-Monteith's equations for calculating ET, the
 coding for Hargraves' and Penman-Monteith's equations are incomplete, and are therefore turned
 off. The WEPP model adequately accounts for seasonal and climatic fluctuations, spatiotemporal
 difference in vegetation, and physiographic differences. Recommended improvements to the WEPP
 model's ET routine are: 1) completing the coding of the Penman-Monteith equation, 2) computing
 evaporation of intercepted precipitation, and 3) computing evaporation from water bodies and litter.

$Title=Effectiveness of needle cast at reducing erosion after forest fires
$Year=2003
$Authors= Pannkuk, Robichaud
$category=fire
$Publisher=WRR
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Needle cast from partially burnt conifer trees commonly occurs after forest fires.
  The effectiveness of needles in reducing soil erosion was investigated in this study.
  Two needle types, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir needles, were used at four different cover amounts (0, 15, 40, and 70 percent) on granitic and volcanic derived soils.
  Simulated rainfall was used to examine interrill erosion; added inflow was used to determine rill erosion in a laboratory setting.
  After a series of "runs," data showed that sediment delivery was greater for the granitic soil compared with the volcanic soil.
  Douglas fir needles were more effective at reducing interrill erosion compared with the ponderosa pine needles.
  Ponderosa pine needles, because of their shape and being bundled together, often caused minidebris dams to form.
  The minidebris dams formed by ponderosa pine needles reduce flow within the rill, resulting in less rill erosion than the Douglas fir needles.
  A 50 percent cover of Douglas fir needles reduced interrill erosion by 80 percent and rill erosion 20 by percent.
  A 50 percent cover of ponderosa pine needles reduced interrill erosion by 60 percent and rill erosion by 40 percent.
  We also compared the effectiveness of using stream power, rather than shear stress, to model rill erosion.
  Stream power was a better predictor of sediment load than shear stress.
  Rill detachment rates based on stream power decreased with increasing cover for both needle types.
  These results challenge the use of shear stress detachment rates in current erosion models and provide insight into the use of stream power detachment rates.

$Title=Impacts of fire on hydrology and erosion in steep mountain big sagebrush communities
$Year=2003
$Authors=Robichaud

$Publisher=ARS
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Wildfire is an important ecological process and
  management issue on western rangelands. Major
  unknowns associated with wildfire are its affects on
  vegetation and soil conditions that influence
  hydrologic processes including infiltration, surface
  runoff, erosion, sediment transport, and flooding.
  Post wildfire hydrologic response was studied in big
  sagebrush plant communities on steep slopes with
  coarse-textured soils. Significant rill erosion was
  observed following both thunderstorm and rapid
  snowmelt events. Rainfall simulation and controlled
  overland flow techniques were used to study post-fire
  effects on infiltration, and interrill and rill
  erosion processes on burned and adjacent unburned
  areas. Results indicate that burn severity and the
  development of water repellent soil conditions play
  significant roles in determining infiltration and
  interrill erosion rates, particularly on shrub coppice
  dunes characterized by high surface litter
  accumulations. The most dramatic and long-lasting
  affect of fire was on rill erosion processes by
  reducing ground cover needed to slow and spread
  water as it moves across the soil surface. Ongoing
  research efforts are aimed at characterizing the
  hydrologic impacts of prescribed fire used as a tool
  to manage vegetation and mitigate the impacts of
  catastrophic wildfire events.

  Our team was asked to analyze and comment on the
  existing knowledge and science related to postfire
  rehabilitation treatments, with particular emphasis
  on the known effectiveness of these treatments.
  The general effects of fire on Western forested landscapes
  are well documented (Agee 1993; DeBano and others
  1998; Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974) and have been
  thoroughly discussed in other chapters of this report.
  However, postfire erosion and rehabilitation treatment
  effectiveness have not been studied extensively.
  <br><br>
  The first part of this chapter describes the postfire
  conditions, as identified by the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) team,
  and the subsequent BAER team recommendations for rehabilitation treatment.
  The next sections describe the different treatments, where they were applied on the Hayman
  Fire burn area, and the current knowledge of treatment effectiveness.
  The recommendations for monitoring treatment effectiveness will answer the specific question,
  "What types of monitoring protocol and reports should Forest Service and other jurisdictions
  put in place to continue to learn from this fire?"
  and outline a general process for monitoring postfire rehabilitation efforts.
  This is followed by a description of the sites currently established within the
  Hayman Fire burned area to evaluate the effectiveness of various rehabilitation treatments.
  The need to establish control sites (burned but not treated) to
  provide a basis for comparison and monitor natural recovery is also discussed.
  The final section identifies the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to
  guide the selection of postfire rehabilitation treatments on future fires in the Colorado Front Range
  and similar environments.

$Abstract=Agricultural straw is used in forested areas of the United States for
  erosion control on burned areas, harvest landings, decommissioned road prisms,

  Two blends of wood strands were statistically equal to straw in
  reducing both runoff and sediment production.
  Both the straw and each of the wood fiber mixes reduced erosion by 98 percent
  as compared to the bare soil.
  This result implies that wood fibers are an acceptable alternative to
  agricultural straw in erosion control applications.
  Further work is underway to determine optimum width and length mixes,
  application rates, and decomposition rates for the wood fibers.

$Title=The challenges in developing the WEPP cumulative effects model

$authorblock=
$Abstract=Many of the forests in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world are
  source areas for water.
  The quantity and quality of this water are major public concerns.
  In a forested watershed, any road segment, harvesting operation, or other
  management activity can adversely impact forest streams.
  These disturbances are distributed in both time and space.
  THe disturbance in the first year may have minimal impact on the hydrologic
  integrity of the watershed, but if the disturbance in the following year
  is added to the first, and the disturbance in year th3 added to those in
  years 1 and 2, the net effect may be detrimental to the beneficial uses
  of the stream.
  A model to address this cumulative impact is sometimes refered to as a
  cumulative effects model.
  This paper presents the application of the GeoWEPP Geographic Information
  System (GIS) tool to evaluating cumulative effects in forests due to fuel
  management activities.
  An example is given to demonstrate the utility and limitations of the
  current tool.

$Abstract=This study assesses the accuracy of GeoWEPP model (Geospatial Water Erosion
Prediction Project) and a modified version of WEPP for forest soils. Three small
watersheds (2-9 ha) in the Interior Northwest were monitored for several years following
timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed site factors of climate variables, percent
ground cover and soil erodibility values, along with digital slope data were used to drive
the models. The GeoWEPP and WEPP model predictions of runoff and sediment yield
were compared to observed yearly totals from each watershed. Monthly totals were also
compared the results of the modified version of WEPP. The yearly results showed that
GeoWEPP under-predicts runoff and sediment and the results were not acceptable at a 90
percent confidence interval. The same data was tested with the modified version of
WEPP containing modified algorithms for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow
intended to better represent forest hydrology. This modified version of the WEPP model
showed improvements to yearly predictions of runoff and sediment over the GeoWEPP
model and generated acceptable results of runoff and sediment. Monthly values of runoff
and sediment yield generated by the modified WEPP generated acceptable results
compared to the observed monthly values. The GeoWEPP model has the potential to
model erosion with the incorporation of digital elevation data, but lacks the ability to
accurately represent forest hydrology. The incorporation of a WEPP algorithm that
represent forest soils more realistically would improve the results of GeoWEPP
predictions.

$Abstract=The summer of 2002 was one of the worst fire seasons in history, especially for the
 state of Colorado where the Hayman Fire burned nearly 60,000 ha. Almost a third of the
 fire was classified as a high severity burn, which often translates into a high erosion
 potential. After a fire, soils are frequently rendered water repellent due to the burning of
 vegetation and surface organic matter. Two methods of testing water repellent soils were
 performed on the Hayman Fire, the traditional water drop penetration time (WDPT) test
 and a new mini-disk infiltrometer test. The ability of these two methods to identify water
 repellent soils in relation to burn severity was tested as well as the compatibility between
 the tests. The moderately burned sites exhibited the strongest and most persistent water
 repellency according to both WDPT and infiltrometer tests. The WDPT and infiltrometer
 values were correlated for each individual burn severity class as well as overall. As the
 infiltrometer is still in experimental stages, we recommend both tests be used for method
 comparison and evaluation.
 <br><br>
 After evaluation of the ground data, a hyperspectral image that was acquired after
 the fire was analyzed in an attempt to remotely identify soil water repellency. Remote
 detection of organic matter in soils has been studied extensively and wavebands that were
 previously identified as useful were analyzed for spectral features indicative of water
 repellency. No features were found to correlate well with soil water repellency, mostly
 because of the overall dampening the blackness from the fire had on soil spectral
 signatures. A supervised classification was run with the mean spectral signatures of low,
 moderate and high water repellency soils as endmembers. The accuracy of the
 classification for identifying the degree of severity of soil water repellency was low, but
 the ability to identify the presence of soil water repellency was nearly 80 percent.
 According to the classification, approximately 20 percent of the Hayman Fire was at a high
 risk for soil erosion, and these are the areas on which erosion mitigation should be focused.

$Title=GPS-assisted road surveys and GIS-based road erosion modeling using the WEPP model
$Year=2003
$Authors=Elliot
$category=roads
$Publisher=ASAE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Roads have been identified as a major source of sediment loading to streams in most forested watersheds.
 The Watershed Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, as developed by the USDA-Forest Service,
 simulates the detachment and delivery of sediment through a road, fill, and buffer system.
 Time and budget constraints typically prevent a comprehensive sediment loading analysis using the
 WEPP model throughout a large watershed.
 We describe a step-by-step approach to allow use of the WEPP model to simulate erosion throughout a large road network.
 Road attributes are acquired from detailed global positioning system-assisted road surveys and mapped in a
 geographic information system (GIS).
 After data manipulation in GIS and Excel, the required input files for the WEPP model are developed.
 The approach was applied to 1017&nbsp;km of road, divided into 6955 road segments, throughout a 3040&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>
 watershed, ranging in elevation from 377&nbsp;m to 2706&nbsp;m.
 The approach can be applied to insloped, outsloped, and crowned road designs, multiple climate regimes,
 and unique physical attributes for each road segment.
 Analysis of the WEPP results within a GIS provides a spatially explicit tool for the management and evaluation
 of sediment production throughout large road networks.

$Abstract=Agricultural straw is widely used as an erosion mitigation measure on disturbed soils.
  It has several drawbacks, however, which include increasing intrinsic value,
  increasing transportatin costs, weed source, pesticide residues, and dust.
  An alternative is wood  strands manufactured from small diameter timber or
  low-value veneer.
  A study to determine the efficacy of wood strands as an alternative to straw
  showed that straw and two types of wood strands were equally effective in
  reducing erosion by over 98%.
  The authors believe that there are opportunities to exceed the erosion
  control performance of agricultural straw through the disciplined design
  of a wood analog.
  Work is continuing to improve the wood strand properties for further field
  testing.

$Title=Infiltration rates on abandoned road--stream crossings

$Publisher=ASAE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Road obliteration, the process of removing culverts, restoring stream
 gradient, and recontouring the road to match the hillside, is one of the tools
 to deal with excess forest roads.
 After road obliteration former stream crossings are locations where sediment
 travel distances to the aquatic environment are short.
 A study to determine the infiltration characteristics and raindrop splash
 characteristics found that infiltrationw as approximately 10 mm/h for former
 roads that had been obliterated for 2 to 3 years.
 This value was less than typical forest floor values of 80 mm/h, but greater
 than road ones of 2 mm/h.
 Raindrop splash coefficients of 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg s / m<sup>4</sup> were
 closer to road than to forest floor conditions.
 Even though the increase in infiltration was modest, an improvement from 2 to
 10 mm/h, results of WEPP model predictions of runoff events from 30 years
 of simulated climate indicated a large reduction in the number of runoff events
 from both rainfall as well as snowmelt events.

$Abstract=This paper reviews the environmental impacts of forest roads at the on-site and the
 watershed scale. The components of a road prism--the cut slopem ditch, running
 surface, and fill slope--are defined and a description of the infiltration and flow
 processes are made for both insloped and outsloped roads. The perceived advantages
 of both are discussed. Flow on the road prism without traffic and a long-term study of
 the sediment production also follow. Some of the differences in sediment production
 between traffic and no-traffic conditions are highlighted, and the results of three
 studies of sediment production from roads with traffic are also discussed. Two
 methods to mitigate the impact of road traffic are reviewed. At the watershed scale,
 two studies that used the same data, but reached opposing conclusions are discussed.
 There is also a review of a study investigating the connection of a road system and
 stream network. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research on both
 on-site and watershed scales.

$Abstract=Selection of suitable locally available materials to build strong and
durable roads with aggregate surfaces is desired to minimize road construction
and maintenance costs and to minimize the detrimental
effects of sedimentation. Eighteen aggregates were selected from local
sources in Idaho, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington State.
Aggregate was placed in shallow metal frames and compacted to simulate
a forest road. The levels of runoff and sediment from a high-intensity,
long-duration simulated rainstorm were measured. The
material tests selected for use in the study included ones that define
the basic characteristics of the aggregate, along with a number of tests
intended to predict susceptibility to erosion. Each of the tests was statistically
evaluated to identify those that best predicted the perceived
aggregate quality. The two best indicators of aggregate quality were
the results of the sand equivalent test and the P20 portion of the Oregon
air degradation test. The best indicator of either runoff or sediment
production was the fraction passing the 0.6-mm sieve. Acceptable
aggregates, both those of good quality and those of marginal quality,
exhibited a 2-order-of-magnitude range in both runoff and sediment
production.

$Abstract=Mass failure is one of the most common failures of low-volume roads in
 mountainous terrain. Current methods for evaluating stability of these
 roads require a geotechnical specialist. A stability analysis program,
 XSTABL, was used to estimate the stability of 3,696 combinations of
 road geometry, soil, and groundwater conditions. A sensitivity analysis
 was carried out to find the most important site-specific variables in estimating
 slope stability, and two regression equations were developed to
 predict the factor of safety (FS) for a given road, one with the ground-water
 below the road fill and one with the groundwater in the road fill.
 The resulting equations predicted failures on road segments where failures
 were observed to have occurred. A comparison of the predicted FSs
 from the regression equations with the FS values predicted by the infinite
 slope equation showed that both methods predicted similar FSs.

$abstract=Water quality laws require regulatory agencies to identify the beneficial uses of streams and rivers,

   The amount of pollutant that can be tolerated for a given beneficial use is the total maximum daily load (TMDL).
   In forest watersheds, sediment is generally the greatest pollutant.
   Sediment sources include surface erosion from forested hillslopes and roads, mass failure, and channel erosion.
   <br><br>
   One of the questions managers are seeking to answer is how to relate forest practices to sediment loads.
   The purpose of this paper is to present a tool that can predict daily sediment delivery to forest streams,
   and to discuss the implications of its application.

  <i>Geomorphic Impacts of Wildfire I</i>,
  October 27-30, 2002, Colorado Convention Center, Denver, CO.
  Paper No. 143-10.
$Abstract=Wildfire is a major ecological process and management issue in the western U.S.
 The 2000, 2001 and 2002 fire seasons were some of the biggest in history with over 2 million ha burned annually.
 What happens when the rains come? Most wildfires create a patchwork of low, moderate, and high severity burn areas, often causing spatially varied hydrologic surface conditions.
 Severely burned areas often have increased erosion due to loss of the protective forest floor layer and loss of water storage as well as creation of water repellent soil conditions.
 Erosion is a natural process occurring at varying rates and scales depending on soil type, topography, vegetation, climate and type of disturbance.
 Erosion rates in a forest environment are generally small except when the ground surface is disturbed by human or natural causes.
 First year surface erosion rates after the Bitterroot Valley, Montana wildfires indicate that short duration high intensity thunderstorms (10-min max. intensity 75 mm/hr) caused the highest erosion rates (2 to 40 t/ha), whereas the long duration low intensity rain events produced little erosion (0.01 t/ha).
  <br><br>
 To control erosion and flooding potential, post-fire rehabilitation treatments are commonly used.
 Some mitigation treatments may help reduce erosion for some rain events but not all events.
 Using low-intensity rainfall simulation techniques we compared three common post-fire emergency rehabilitation 
 treatments--contour-felled logs, straw wattles, and hand trenches--at reducing erosion as compared to non-treated areas.
 The straw wattles and contour-felled logs reduce erosion by 70 percent for these small rain events.
 But during intense summer thunderstorms (40 mm/hr, 10-min max intensity) there were smaller differences between treatments with the straw wattles showing the most reduction in erosion.
 Other laboratory studies suggest that brown needles that commonly fall to the ground after low and moderate severity burns may reduce rill erosion by 30 to 40 percent and interrill erosion by 50 to 70 percent.

$abstract=Our team has been asked to review and comment on immediate postfire effects.
 Specifically, we were asked to review the existing knowledge and science on changes
  in watershed responses and effectiveness of postfire rehabilitation treatments.
 We will review monitoring protocols and techniques related to erosion, water
  quality, and treatment effectiveness that are appropriate for burned areas.
 Additionally, we will identify appropriate untreated areas that should be established
  to allow meaningful comparison to natural recovery.
 Finally, we will identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to guide the selection of
  postfire rehabilitation treatments.
 <br><br>
 Our approach first builds on the current literature pertaining to postfire changes in watershed
  response and sedimentation.
 Then we describe the soils, hydrology, values at risk, and selection of treatment methods
  for the Hayman Fire area.
 This is followed by current knowledge of postfire rehabilitation treatment effectiveness with
  a focus on treatments that are being used on the Hayman Fire area.
 We continue with a discussion of monitoring protocols.
 We finish by delineating the shortfalls in our knowledge and the uncertainty we have in the
  effectiveness of the rehabilitation treatments currently being used.

$Abstract=The WEPP model is a daily runoff and erosion prediction model.  We propose the use of 
 this model to predict peak runoff rates from forested watersheds.  We compared Curve Number 
 methods to WEPP prediction methods.  Both methods predicted similar 2-hr precipitation amounts,
 which were similar to observed values.  Both methods underpredicted 24-hr runoff amounts, but 
 WEPP more closely predicted peak runoff rates.

$Abstract=The WEPP model was used to compare erosion rates from fuel management
 operations, including roads, to erosion following wildfire, the inevitable disturbance in the 
 absence of fuel management, for climates across the western U.S.  The results show that
 erosion from fuel management operations, including thinning and prescribed fire, are less than
 from wildfire, even when road erosion rates are included.

$Abstract=Measuring hillslope erosion has historically been a costly, time-consuming practice. An easy to
 install low-cost technique using silt fences (geotextile fabric) and tipping bucket rain gauges to measure
 onsite hillslope erosion was developed and tested. Equipment requirements, installation procedures, statistical
 design, and analysis methods for measuring hillslope erosion are discussed. The use of silt fences is
 versatile; various plot sizes can be used to measure hillslope erosion in different settings and to determine
 effectiveness of various treatments or practices. Silt fences are installed by making a sediment trap facing
 upslope such that runoff cannot go around the ends of the silt fence. The silt fence is folded to form a pocket
 for the sediment to settle on and reduce the possibility of sediment undermining the silt fence. Cleaning out
 and weighing the accumulated sediment in the field can be accomplished with a portable hanging or platform
 scale at various time intervals depending on the necessary degree of detail in the measurement of
 erosion (that is, after every storm, quarterly, or seasonally). Silt fences combined with a tipping bucket rain
 gauge provide an easy, low-cost method to quantify precipitation/hillslope erosion relationships. Trap efficiency
 of the silt fences is greater that 90 percent, thus making them suitable for use in estimating hillslope erosion.

$Abstract=Stochastic weather generators are often employed with process-based soil erosion prediction models.
 Longterm observed weather station statistics (precipitation, temperature, etc.) can be used to provide a daily series of
 temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and wind parameters needed by an erosion model in its calculations
 for evapotranspiration, plant growth, soil frost and thaw development, snow melt, infiltration, runoff, and soil
 erosion. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) erosion model typically uses the CLIGEN weather
 generator to provide the daily climatic inputs that drive its hydrologic and erosion processes. This presentation
 describes recently identified problems with CLIGEN and its weather station database, as well as enhancements
 to improve the generator program and supporting database.

   <b>Hydrological Processes</b> 15(15): 3053-3066.
$Abstract=Wildfire usually promotes flooding and accelerated erosion in upland watersheds. In the summer of 1999, a high-severity
wildfire burned a series of mixed pine/oak headwater catchments in the San Jacinto Mountains of southern California.
Log erosion barriers (LEBs) were constructed across much of the burned area as an erosion control measure. We
built debris basins in two watersheds, each about 1 ha in area, one with LEBs, the other without, to measure post-fire
hydrologic response and sediment yield and to evaluate the effectiveness of the LEBs. The watersheds are underlain
by granitic bedrock, producing a loamy sand soil above large extents of weathered bedrock and exposed core stones
(tors) on the surface. Measured soil water-repellency was similar over the two catchments. Rain gauges measured
348 mm of precipitation in the first post-fire year. The ephemeral stream channels experienced surface flow after
major rainstorms, and the source of the water was throughflow exfiltration at the slope/channel interface. Post-fire
overland flow produced some rilling, but hillslope erosion measured in silt fences away from any LEBs was minor,
as was sediment accumulation behind the LEBs. Stream channels in the catchments exhibited minor net scour. Water
yield was much greater in the LEB-treated watershed. This resulted in 14 times more sediment yield by weight than
the untreated watershed. Average soil depths determined by augering were nearly double in the catchment without the
LEBs compared with the treated watershed. This suggests that differences in water and sediment yield between the two
catchments are due to the twofold difference in the estimated soil water-holding capacity in the untreated watershed. It
appears that the deeper soils in the untreated watershed were able to retain most of the precipitation, releasing less water
to the channels and thereby reducing erosion and sediment yield. Thus, the test of LEB effectiveness was inconclusive
in this study, because soil depth and soil water-holding capacity may have masked their performance.

$Abstract=Wildfire is a major ecological process and management issue on western rangelands.
 The impacts of wildfire on hydrologic processes such as infiltration, runoff, and erosion are not well understood.
 Small-plot rainfall simulation methods were applied in a rangeland wildfire setting to determine post-fire hydrologic response.
 Infiltration and interrill erosion processes were measured immediately post-fire and one year following the 1999
 34 400 ha Denio fire in northwestern Nevada.
 Plot-scale spatial and temporal variability in fire impacts was compared with adjacent unburned areas.
 An index of water repellency was derived and used to quantify the influence of water-repellent soil conditions on infiltration.
 Results indicate the impact of the fire on infiltration was localized primarily on coppice microsites directly under shrubs
 characterized by high surface litter accumulations.
 Coppice microsites had very uniform fireinduced soil water repellency with 29 of 30 plots exhibiting at least a
 10% reduction in initial infiltration with an average 28% reduction.
 Cumulative erosion was nearly four times higher on burned coppices compared with unburned coppices.
 The impact of the fire on infiltration and erosion was reduced, but still evident, 1 year after fire.
 Significant temporal variability in infiltration between years was observed on both burned and unburned areas,
 complicating the interpretation of fire impacts and hydrologic recovery following wildfire.

$Abstract=Several severe wildfire seasons increased awareness of the role of fire in healthy ecosystems. Research has
focused not only on fire, but also on its effect on ecosystem components and indicators, such as soils, water
quality, and forest health. Precipitation events after wildfires may cause high sediment inputs to streams,
destruction of aquatic habitat and downstream flooding, all of which may be part of the natural ecosystem
response. If, however, fires are more severe due to past fire suppression and land management activities,
then their impact may be greater than under natural conditions. Fire and erosion are both natural processes
that have been impacted by land management activities such as fire suppression, logging, grazing, and road
building during the last century. Regardless of past management activities, increases in runoff, erosion and
sediment yields are of great concern, since they likely will have some downstream effect.
<br>
The ending of the 2000 fire season was a perfect backdrop for the 2000 American Geophysical Union fall
meeting and special session <i>Wildfire and Surficial Processes.</i> Many researchers have started projects looking
at the effects of fire from a hydrological and surficial perspective during the last 5 years. We wanted to capture
and disseminate the new knowledge to aid in management decision-making and to suggest research directions
for future fire events. This issue contains a selection of papers presented during the meeting.
<br>
The issue begins with articles addressing the fire-induced water repellency of soils in both laboratory and
field studies. Letey reviews various methods to assess water-repellent soil conditions and discusses waterentry
pressure as an alternative indicator of water-repellent soils. Huffman <i>et al.</i> compare two techniques to
determine the degree of water repellency after prescribed fire and wildfires in the Colorado Front Range.
<br>
Several infiltration and runoff studies at the hillslope scale are presented. Martin and Moody show
differences in infiltration rates from high burn severity areas to adjacent unburned areas in ponderosa pine
forests. Pierson <i>et al.</i> indicate that range wildfires can reduce infiltration by 28% in the first year, but only
on the areas under the burnt shrubs and not in the interspace areas. In a computer simulation exercise,
Beeson <i>et al.</i> explore the spatial occurrence of overland flow after fire and map a landscape's vulnerability
to post-fire effects. Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald do not detect differences in runoff between burned
and unburned areas on the Colorado Front Range, but do detect an order-of-magnitude difference in sediment
yields. Johansen <i>et al.</i> show that runoff doubled between burned and unburned plots and sediment yields were
20 times higher in a ponderosa pine forest near Los Alamos, New Mexico.
<br>
At the watershed scale, McLin <i>et al.</i> use the HEC model to predict fire-triggered changes in floodplain
geometry. Moody and Martin use channel cross-sections to evaluate the depositional and erosive features
after a wildfire. With the help of a GIS-based model, Wilson et al. predict an order-of-magnitude increase in
erosion and sedimentation.
<br>
Cannon <i>et al.</i> examine immediate fire-related debris flows after the Los Alamos fires, which indicate
threshold conditions for debris flow to occur, whereas Meyer <i>et al.</i> evaluate historic fire-related debris flows
in the Idaho Batholith. Elliot and Parker use stratigraphic and geomorphic evidence in evaluating alluvial
deposits. They use this information to develop recurrence probabilities for fire&ndash;flood sequences.

$Abstract=A model for spatial prediction of landslide hazard is applied to an experimental basin
 affected by landslide events that occurred during the winter of 1995-96, following heavy rains,
 snowmelt, and high river flow. High-resolution digital elevation data with 75 ft x 75 ft resolution
 were used for deriving the topographic attributes used for the modeling. The model is based on
 multivariate methods and assumes that the factors which caused the failure in the past, would
 cause a failure in the future under similar conditions. This model is intended for predicting
 future slope failure when managing forestlands where the major concern is associated with the
 cumulative effects on the entire watershed, such as decreased water quality, loss of spawning
 habitat and organic matter, flowing debris during peak flows, and decision support for road
 maintenance, obliteration, and development of new roads. 
 This type of model allows rapid assessment of spatial correlation of the topographic
 attributes on large areas. The final product of the modeled prediction would delineate areas with
 high probabilities of failure in the basin. At the end the modeled prediction is compared with the
 observed landslide locations to test the strength of the model.

$Abstract=Soil erosion by water is a complex process resulting from the interactions among a number of factors including weather patterns, soil properties, topography, and the influences of surface vegetation.
  Natural variability is a dominant characteristic of each of these factors, which makes predicting soil erosion rates difficult.
  In many forest conditions, and some rangeland conditions, erosion may be minimal under vegetated conditions unless the site is disturbed.
  Disturbances may be fire, logging, grazing, or severe precipitation events.
  The most extreme erosion rates occur when severe weather follows a major disturbance, particularly a severe wildfire. 
  <br><br>
  We are developing an interface to aid in the analysis of erosion prediction following fire, or a similar major disturbance, in forests and rangelands.
  This paper addresses how we intend to incorporate the inherent variability associated with the predicted erosion rate, and how that variability is influenced by weather, spatial distribution of disturbances, and soil properties.

$Abstract= In the years following a major forest disturbance, such as fire, the erosion rate is greatly influenced by variability in weather, in soil properties,
    and in spatial distribution. This paper presents a method to incorporate these variabilities into the erosion rate predicted by the Water Erosion Prediction
    Project model. It appears that it is not necessary to describe both the soil and the vegetation effects of the disturbance. Incorporating the vegetation effects
    on soil erodibility, and its associated variability, is sufficient--when combined with weather and spatial variability--to predict the probabilities of single storm
    and annual soil erosion rates in the years following the disturbance. By redefining the probability distributions of the soils, erosion during the recovering years
    and impacts of mitigation on erosion can be determined from the same initial set of computer runs.

$Abstract=A study to determine the infiltration parameters for filter windrows was undertaken. The study used a flow
 rate representing the runoff from a forest road of 100 m length during a storm of 50 mm/hr. Observations
 during the flow event suggested a hydrophobic-like condition existed for up to 10 minutes. The hydraulic
 conductivity required by the WEPP model to reproduce the field results ranged from 80 to 200 mm/hr in the
 filter windrow and from 60 to 1400 mm/hr in the forest floor. While the 1400 mm/hr value appeared to be due
 to macropores, hydraulic conductivity values of 400 mm/hr for the forest floor were required for proper WEPP
 simulation. These values will be incorporated in the U.S. Forest Service WEPP Road interface.

$Abstract=Renewed interest in land management practices, such as conservation tillage techniques on agricultural lands and
 timber harvesting, prescribed fires and wildfires on forested lands, has made it desirable to measure hillslope soil erosion.
 Measuring soil erosion is generally costly and time consuming requiring expensive equipment, many site
 visits and laboratory analyses. The objective of the study was to determine the suitability of silt fences for measuring
 onsite hillslope erosion. Silt fences are low-cost and easy to install. They commonly are used as an erosion control
 device for construction projects and therefore generally available. For this study a silt fence was installed at the base
 of an existing long-term hillslope erosion plot at the Agricultural Research Service's Palouse Conservation Field
 Station at Pullman, WA. Two seasons of erosion data were collected. The silt fence was installed by making a
 cavity facing upslope such that runoff could not go around the silt fence. Also, the silt fence was folded
 to form a pocket to collect the sediment and eliminate the possibility of undermining the silt fence. Silt fences were
 installed across the width of the plot. The trap efficiency was determined by measuring the collected runoff and
 sediment that flowed through the silt fence compared to the sediment trapped by the silt fence. Results indicate that
 the mean trap efficiency was 93 percent the first year when measured on a storm-by-storm basis and 92 percent
 efficient the second year when only measured at the end of the runoff season. Thus various time intervals can be
 used depending of the detail of the erosion rates that are of interest, for example after every storm or seasonally
 without compromising its trap efficiency.

$Abstract=Rangeland runoff and erosion rates are highly dependent on the type and amount of vegetative cover as well
 as climate and topography. Three rangeland erosion prediction models--RUSLE, WEPP for rangelands, and FS&nbsp;WEPP
 for rangelands--were compared to observed sedimentation rates on five small southeastern Colorado
 watersheds. RUSLE and the FS&nbsp;WEPP interface gave predictions similar to the observed values for
 sedimentation. The WEPP rangeland templates underpredicted erosion and overpredicted runoff. Both
 versions of WEPP were able to predict runoff as a function of upland topography and vegetation, making future
 development of more complex rangeland watershed sedimentation prediction feasible.

$Abstract=The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is a state-of-the-art soil erosion model applicable to a
 wide range of vegetation, soil, and climatic conditions. The CLIGEN weather generator is distributed with WEPP.
 The CLIGEN database contained some errors and did not include many climate stations in
 mountainous areas where most forests are located and where climate is highly variable. Errors in the database
 were identified and corrected. The database was expanded from 1,100 stations to more than 2,600. In addition,
 the ability to modify the statistics for a climate station has been developed to allow users to enter their own
 weather station statistics into a web-based computer interface. Users can enter specific values, change existing
 values by a percentage, modify the annual amount, or adjust temperatures with elevation. The PRISM monthly
 precipitation database was incorporated into the interface to aid users in predicting climates at remote sites. The
 designated changes are made to an existing CLIGEN parameter file to generate a modified climate file. The
 modified climate file may be selected for use with a Forest Service WEPP interface, or it may be used to
 generate a climate file for use with the WEPP model. The enhancements can be accessed from a web site.

$Abstract=Wildfire and forest operations remove vegetation and disturb forest soils.
	Both of these effects can lead to an increased risk of soil erosion. Operations to reduce
	forest fuel loads, however, may reduce the risk of wildfire. This paper presents research
	and modeling results which show that under many conditions, carefully planned operations,
	with adequate buffers, result in lower long-term erosion rates than those experienced following
	wildfire, which is inevitable if fuel loads are not reduced. The effects of reducing
	fire-induced flood flows on forest stream systems, however, are unknown.

$Abstract=Soil erosion models have been under development since the late 1930s. Technologies for
	prediction began with simple tables and equations culminating in the 1950s with the Universal Soil Loss Equation.
	In the 1960s, digital computers allowed scientists to model the processes that cause erosion.
	These early models required complex databases and a high degree of user skill to operate; therefore they were used
	primarily by the research community. One such process-based erosion model is the Water Erosion Prediction
	Project (WEPP) model. The USDA Forest Service wanted to use WEPP but found, following a number
	of workshops, that the model was too complex for field specialists to use. To capture the scientific
	capabilities of WEPP for Forest Service users, specialized interfaces were developed (using HTML, Perl and
	JavaScript) to allow users to run WEPP over the Internet using a standard browser. Alternatively,
	with the addition of a small web server application, the same specialized interfaces and erosion and climate
	models can be installed on personal computers for users without Internet access. The user generates site
	characterization data and climate data by running the CLIGEN program using several large climate databases.
	These data are used by the WEPP erosion model to predict runoff, upland erosion, and hillslope sediment
	delivery. The displays of the results from the WEPP model are designed to meet user needs. These interfaces
	to WEPP are rapidly gaining acceptance by specialists in the Forest Service and many other agencies and
	universities. Similar interfaces are under development for cropland and rangeland applications of the WEPP
	model and for slope stability modeling.

$Abstract=Fuel and land management activities in the past
	century have placed wildland values such as soil and water quality at greater risk due to increased soil erosion.
	Eroded sediment can lead to decreased long-term soil productivity and can adversely impact aquatic ecosystems.
	Higher runoff rates from severely burned landscapes can lead to flooding and increased risk to human life and property.
	Over the past ten years, we have completed studies on eight sites in the Northwestern and Southeastern U.S. measuring erosion impacts associated with prescribed burning.
	We are now carrying out field and laboratory studies addressing knowledge gaps in our understanding of
	fuel management practices on soil erosion, and developing a user-friendly computer interface 
	to evaluate the risk and consequences of erosion hazards following wildfires, mitigation treatments,
	and prescribed burns. Specific tasks that we are addressing include: determining hillslope
	characteristics that govern dry ravel processes such as slope steepness, vegetation density, soil texture
	and disturbance impacts; determining the spatial and temporal variability in infiltration and erosion
	parameters needed to predict overland flow and soil detachment after wildfire; quantifying effectiveness
	of three mitigation practices in reducing sediment production for specified design storms following
	wildfires; and evaluating measured erosion rates and estimates of sediment production after wildfires at
	the upland watershed/catchment scale. Data collection has begun from a burned-over catchment
	and preliminary results are presented. Additional discussion addresses methodologies and
	approaches to evaluate and model erosion risk and hazard.

$Abstract=Wildfires in steep forest environments can often produce disasterous runoff and soil loss after rainstorms.
  There is often needle cast from partially burnt conifer trees that generally falls to the soil surface within several months after the fire.
  These needles offer protection from soil erosion that is not fully understood.
  A laboratory experiment was conducted using rainfall simulation to determine the interaction of needle type and percent cover on soil erosion.
  Results indicate that needle type and percent cover greatly impact soil erosion processes.
  A log-decay relationship provided a good fit of the data.
  These relationships will be useful for the assessment of erosion potential after forest fires from a practical as well as a modeling standpoint.

$Abstract=Following wildfires, burned areas are assessed by special teams to determine whether emergency watershed rehabilitation measures are required to restore watershed function and minimize damage to soil resources.
  The objective of burned area emergency rehabilitation (BAER) treatments is to restore watershed condition and reduce erosional losses on hillslopes, in channels, and on road surfaces and peripheral areas such as ditches.
  In the Western United States, a project is currently in progress to determine the costs and effectiveness of BAER projects in restoring watershed function.
  Results of this project will help establish the future directions of the BAER program into the 21st century. <BR>

$Abstract=Increased awareness of the role of fire in healthy ecosystems has focused attention on some of the effects of fires, wild and prescribed, on watershed condition and health.
  Precipitation events after forest fires may cause high sediment inputs, destruction of aquatic habitat and downstream flooding, all of which may be part of the natural ecosystem response.
  However, if the fires are more severe due to past fire suppression activities, then the fire effects may be greater than natural.
  Fire and erosion are both natural processes that have been impacted by forest management activities such as fire suppression, logging, and road building during the last century.
  Management activities may contribute to increased streamflows and increased sediment supplies to streams and rivers.
  Additional sediment places streams and rivers at a higher risk for degradation.
  Sediment adversely affects spawning and rearing sites for anadromous and resident fish species, mobilizes in-stream sediment, and destroys aquatic habitat.
  Therefore, various management and mitigation strategies are often devised to reduce the threat of increased sediment.
  This paper reviews the effects of fire on hillslope erosion and the associated risks on watershed health. 
  Fire is a natural and important part of the disturbance regime for forested terrestrial and aquatic systems, especially in the western USA.
  However, much uncertainty exists in quantifying fire effects on ecosystem components such as watershed condition and health.

$Abstract=Spending on postfire emergency watershed rehabilitation has increased during the past decade.
  A west-wide evaluation of USDA Forest Service burned area emergency rehabilitation (BAER) treatment
  effectiveness was undertaken as a joint project by USDA Forest Service Research and National Forest
  System staffs. This evaluation covers 470 fires and 321 BAER projects, from 1973 through 1998 in USDA
  Forest Service Regions 1 through 6. A literature review, interviews with key Regional and Forest BAER
  specialists, analysis of burned area reports, and review of Forest and District monitoring reports were
  used in the evaluation. The study found that spending on rehabilitation has increased to over $48 million
  during the past decade because the perceived threat of debris flows and floods has increased where fires
  are closer to the wildland-urban interface. Existing literature on treatment effectiveness is limited, thus
  making treatment comparisons difficult. The amount of protection provided by any treatment is small.
  Of the available treatments, contour-felled logs show promise as an effective hillslope treatment because
  they provide some immediate watershed protection, especially during the first postfire year. Seeding has
  a low probability of reducing the first season erosion because most of the benefits of the seeded grass
  occurs after the initial damaging runoff events. To reduce road failures, treatments such as properly
  spaced rolling dips, water bars, and culvert reliefs can move water past the road prism. Channel
  treatments such as straw bale check dams should be used sparingly because onsite erosion control is
  more effective than offsite sediment storage in channels in reducing sedimentation from burned
  watersheds. From this review, we recommend increased treatment effectiveness monitoring at the
  hillslope and sub-catchment scale, streamlined postfire data collection needs, increased training on
  evaluation postfire watershed conditions, and development of an easily accessible knowledge base of
  BAER techniques.

$Abstract=Environmental attributes relevant for spatial prediction of landslides triggered by rain and
  snowmelt events were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Those data in conjunction
  with statistics and a geographic information system (GIS) provided a detailed basis for spatial
  prediction of landslide hazard. The spatial prediction of landslide hazard in this paper is based on
  discriminant analysis. Discriminant analysis is a multivariate technique that can be used to build
  rules that can classify elements or observations successfully between stable and unstable
  areas. The discriminant rule would show how to take into account the relative risks of making
  errors of misclassification. Those general rules allow managers to consider that errors in one
  direction may be much more costly than errors in the other direction.

$Abstract=The Inland Northwest U.S. has experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years.
  This research focuses on the Clearwater National Forest (CWNF) in central Idaho, and outlines the development of datasets, methods, and maps for the spatial prediction of landslide hazard.
  Terrain attributes are directly calculated from digital elevation models (DEMs) and include variables such as elevation, slope, plan and profile curvature, flow path length, and specific catchment area.
  The DEM-derived datasets are combined with a diversity of other digital datasets including climate surfaces, bedrock geology, roads, landslide events, and landcover.
  The datasets are combined in a geographic information system (GIS) for landslide exploration of correlation and statistical model development to predict the probability of occurrence or hazard.
  Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of occurrence in tandem with the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve as a measure of performance of a predictive rule.
  The ROC curve is a plot of the probability of having true positive identified landslides versus the probability of false positive identified landslides as the cut-off probability varies.
  The resulting product may be used for forest planning and decision support for maintenance, obliteration or development of forest roads.
  Predictions of increased local climate variability and extreme events portend that hazard maps are critical for minimizing negative impacts on forest infrastructure and environmental degradation due to sediment pulses and stream course obliteration.

$Abstract=A prime forest resource is clean water for downstream beneficial uses.
 Sediment from forests may impair those beneficial uses. Sedimentation by water erosion is rare unless
 road activities, timber harvesting, or fire disturb the forest. We have been researching
 forest soil erosion processes and developing erosion prediction models for more than 10 years.
 This paper presents an overview of some of our findings.
 <br><br>
 Rut formation dominates road erosion processes. Road maintenance practices that reduce
 rutting also reduce erosion rates. Road ditches can also be a major source of sediment if
 the ditches are recently disturbed from construction or maintenance. Generally, if roads
 are properly designed and located at a sufficient distance from nearby streams, then
 stream sedimentation is minimal.
 <br><br>
 Forest harvesting activities can lead to increased erosion due to the exposure of mineral
 soil or the alteration of soil properties due to compaction. Fires can lead to major erosion
 in forests, especially during the first few years after the fire. Spatial variability of the
 severity of disturbance is common after fire. Fire effects include a reduction in soil
 hydraulic conductivity and a loss of the protective organic layer on the soil surface.
 These two impacts can increase erosion rates by several magnitudes.
 <br><br>
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model can model disturbed forest erosion
 processes. WEPP can be a powerful tool to provide quantitative estimates of the amount
 of sediment entering forest streams for many management activities. Templates for the
 current WEPP model and user-friendly interfaces have been developed to assist field
 managers to apply this technology to various forest conditions.

$Title=Fire effects on infiltration rates after prescribed fire in northern Rocky Mountain forests, USA

	<a><i>Fire effects on infiltration rates after prescribed fire in northern Rocky Mountain forests, USA.</i></a>
	<b>Journal of Hydrology.</b> 231-232(2000): 220-229.
$Abstract=Infiltration rates in undisturbed forest environments are generally high. These high
 infiltration rates may be reduced when forest management activities such as timber harvesting
 and/or prescribed fires are used. Post-harvest residue burning is a common site preparation
 treatment used in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, to reduce forest fuels and to prepare
 sites for natural and artificial tree regeneration. Prescribed burn operations attempt to leave sites
 with the surface condition of a low-severity burn. However, some of the areas often experience
 surface conditions associated with a high-severity burn which may result in hydrophobic or
 water repellent conditions. In this study, infiltration rates were measured after logging slash was
 broadcast burned from two prescribed burns. The two sites were in Northern Rocky mountain coniferous
 forests of Douglas-fir/lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir. Simulated rainfall was
 applied to one-square meter plots in three, 30-minute applications at 94 mm h<sup>-1</sup> within the three
 surface conditions found after the burn: unburned-undisturbed areas, low-severity burn areas and
 high-severity burn areas.
 <br><br>
 Runoff hydrographs from the rainfall simulations were relatively constant from the plots
 that were in unburned-undisturbed areas and in areas subjected to a low-severity burn. These
 constant runoff rates indicate constant hydraulic conductivity values for these surface conditions
 even though there was variation between plots. Hydrographs from the rainfall simulation plots
 located within areas of high-severity burn indicate greater runoff rates than the plots in low-severity
 burn areas especially during the initial stages of the first rainfall event. These runoff
 rates decreased to a constant rate for the last 10 minutes of the event. These results indicate
 hydrophobic or water repellent soil conditions, which temporarily cause a 10 to 40 percent
 reduction in hydraulic conductivity values when compared to a normal infiltrating soil condition.
 Because variability was high for these forest conditions, cumulative distribution algorithms of
 hydraulic conductivity provide a means to account for the inherent variability associated with
 these hillslopes and different surface conditions caused by fire.

$Abstract=Highly variable water repellent soil conditions have been reported after forest fires. We examined
 interactions among heating, soil water content and soil texture on water repellency. Undisturbed, 305-mm
 diameter cores were collected in the field from four soils commonly referred to as ash-cap, mixed ash-cap, no
 ash-cap and granitic soils. Three artificial burning treatments and a control (no heat) and two soil water contents
 were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Twenty water drops were placed on each soil layer starting at the
 surface and continuing at 10 mm intervals to a depth of 70 mm, and the times to infiltrate were recorded. The
 dry control treatment was more water repellent than the wet control treatment. The dry, low heat treatment was
 the most repellent, 10 to 20 mm below the soil surface with mean water drop penetration times greater that 60&nbsp;s.
 Repellency decreased as the heating increased. In wet soils of the high heat treatment, a water repellent layer was
 generally detected 30 to 50 mm below the soil surface. Presumably, hydrophobic substances were translocated
 along the temperature gradient which cooled at depth (&lt; 50 mm) causing condensation on the soil particles.
 Water repellency after prescribed fire would probably be minimal because long heating times are not common.

$Abstract=Most common soil erosion models were developed for agricultural conditions and then modified for rangeland,
	forest, and other applications. Rill and interrill
	erosion generally dominate upland agricultural erosion on recently tilled fields. In
	rangelands, soil is not tilled, rainfall is sporadic, infiltration is high, and the soil
	surface is covered by vegetation residues and sometimes rocks. Recent research has
	shown that as rangeland plant species change from the tall grass species that once
	dominated many plant communities, to short grass species through overgrazing, the
	hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreases and runoff increases. The net impact of
	the rangeland surface and plant changes is that upland erosion may be low, and the
	dominant source of sediment from rangelands may be from channels.
	This paper describes a study in southeastern Colorado on sedimentation from
	rangeland watersheds. The observed rates are compared to predicted erosion rates
	from a locally developed erosion model, RUSLE, the WEPP model with typical
	rangeland vegetation and soil scenarios, and the rangeland predictions from the Forest
	Service WEPP interface and database. The local regression model and the Forest
	Service WEPP interface best predicted sedimentation from small rangeland watersheds.
	RUSLE overpredicted sediment yields by a factor of 3, and the WEPP
	rangeland predictions were 1/6 the observed sediment yields. In a sensitivity analysis
	with the FS WEPP interface, as cover increases, differences in runoff and erosion between soils decreases.

$Abstract=Soil erosion is one of the key concerns in forest resource management.
	Human activities often aggravate sediment production and transport, leading to significantly elevated
	sediment levels in forest streams and adversely impacting stream water quality, channel
	stability, and aquatic habitat. Presently, the health and viability of fish stocks in the
	northwest US is becoming a critical issue for the government and the general public.
	Improvement of our understanding of forest soil erosion is of pressing importance. The main
	purpose of this study is to evaluate forest road erosion processes using a modeling approach.
	A refined version of WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project), a physically-based,
	distributed-parameter erosion prediction model, was chosen as the foundation for the
	modeling effort. A segment of an insloping forest road with an impoundment or surface
	cross drain structure, together with the roadside ditch channel and a waterway channel
	below the drainage structure, was conceptualized and modeled as a small watershed. WEPP
	was applied to simulate gross sediment yield within the watershed and sediment delivery at
	its outlet. Different road system configurations with respect to the density of the drainage
	structures along a road and downslope road gradient were examined under climate and soil
	conditions for a representative forest watershed in Idaho State. Soil erosion and delivery
	ratios resulting from the two road drainage system designs were compared. In addition, cost
	analyses based on the standard information about material and labor cost were performed
	to identify road drainage structure designs that can lead to minimized soil erosion and
	sediment delivery, while proving economically justifiable. Results from this study show that
	WEPP is a useful tool in predicting water erosion from insloping forest roads with
	impoundment or cross drain structures as well as in helping establish optimum road drainage system designs.

	networks, while minimizing the ecological impacts of those road systems on the environment.
	Properly spacing road drains for soils, topography, and slope conditions
	can reduce erosion from road surfaces, subsequently reducing sedimentation risk elsewhere.
	Knowledge about the amount of soil eroded and delivered from the road
	system is valuable when making decisions about road drainage design or redesign.
	The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process based erosion
	model that can be used to simulate low volume road erosion, was used to create a database
	of erosion estimates for 72,900 different road configurations, locations, and soil types.
	This database was then used to derive equations for low volume road erosion and runoff.
	A multivariate regression was used to derive equations for road soil loss, road
	runoff, and sediment yield. The resulting equations provided estimates of road soil
	loss and road runoff values within +/- 20% of the original database values. This
	approach also was attempted for sediment delivery across a buffer with less success.
	This is possibly due to complications from antecedent moisture conditions, vegetative
	cover, and sediment loading in runoff.

$Abstract=This study investigated the sediment production from various aggregates.
	The objectives of this study were
	 1) to evaluate the erodibility of a range of aggregate surfacing
	materials and relate it to standard and non-standard specification tests,
	 2) provide a means of specifying aggregate materials and understand the sedimentation implications, and
	 3) to provide a relative ranking of the erosive potential of aggregates.
	To accomplish this,
	eighteen aggregates from the Pacific Northwest were selected based on quality and
	geologic parent material. A suite of aggregate specification tests were performed to
	characterize each aggregate. The sedimentation from a simulated rain storm on a plot
	representing a freshly constructed road section was measured. Traffic was applied and the
	sediment production from a simulated storm was again measured. The two best indicators of
	aggregate quality were Sand Equivalent and Oregon Air P20 test results. Knowledge of
	whether an aggregate was classified as good or marginal was not sufficient to estimate
	sediment production. The best indicator of sediment production was the percent passing the number 30 sieve.

$abstract=Increasing pressure on natural resources has extended forest land management activities into remote moutainous areas.
 Forest roads are an essential element for forest and watershed management.
 However, forest roads are also a major source of sediment production.
 <br><br>
 We used the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to predict sediment from the roads in a timber sale on the Boise National Forest, Idaho.
 The outsloped 4.4 km road was divided into road segments of different lengths, using three levels of detail (high, intermediate, and low).
 Results from each set of runs were assessed to determine what level of detail was necessary.
 For the high detail method, the road segments were identified by changes in road grade and azimuth angle.
 This resulted in 145 segments with an average length of 31 m.
 Buffer slope was determined from 40 ft (12 m) contours along the flow path, with an average buffer length of 370 m.
 For the intermediate detail method, the criterion was less than 2 percentage points of road grade difference between, resulting in 91 segments with an average length of 49 m.
 Buffer slope was measured where major slope breaks occurred along the flow path, with an average buffer length of 360 m.
 For the low detail method, the road segments were identified by road grade reversal.
 This resulted in 41 segments with an average length of 110 m.
 The horizontal distance and elevation difference between two points, road and stream, were measured for each segment.
 The average buffer length was 320 m.
 <br><br>
 The results of this study indicated that road grade reversal was a sufficient criterion for input information for the sediment produced from the roads.
 Buffer slope information required considering major slope breaks.

$Abstract=Prescribed fire is used as a site treatment after timber harvesting.
  These fires result in spatial patterns with some portions consuming all of the forest floor material (duff) and others consuming little.
  Prior to the burn, spatial sampling of duff thickness and duff water content can be used to generate geostatistical spatial simulations of these characteristics.
  Results from field studies indicated that spatial patterns of duff characteristics occurred, and they were then modeled by kriging, simulation and a trend-surface modeling technique.
  The higher elevations of the study unit burned more severely than the lower portion.
  This is believed to be due to both the heat generated by the fire drying out the upper portions of the units, thus consuming more duff material, and the thinner preburn duff thickness due to ground-based harvesting techniques.
  Attempts to predict duff consumption and subsequent post-burn duff thickness were successful using a trend surface model developed for this site and a general duff consumption model.
  Knowledge of spatial patterns of duff remaining may help land managers adjust prescriptions and alter ignition patterns to reduce areas where total consumption of duff might occur.

$Abstract=Low-volume roads can be a major source of sediment to streams in forest watersheds.  
 For soil erosion from roads to be economically mitigated, the processes that cause erosion need 
 to be understood.  The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), a physically based erosion and 
 sedimentation model, was used for predicting erosion from forest roads that can be described as 
 hillslopes.  Watershed applications of WEPP predicted erosion and sedimentation values for insloping 
 roads that can be described as microwatersheds.  How well WEPP models insloping roads through a 
 sensitivity analysis and validation process using two studies in the Oregon Coast Range is discussed.

$Abstract=Low-Volume roads are recognized as one of the primary sources of sediment in many watersheds.
 The authors have carried out research on the details of the complex soil erosion processes occurring on
 low-volume roads for more than 10 years.  An overview of their research summarizes the results of 
 numerous past and ongoing field and computer modeling studies on road erosion processes and the 
 effects of road design on road erosion.  The authors have found that insloping and outsloping 
 effects on roads are often overshadowed by the effects of rutting.  Most  soil erosion on roads 
 is from concentrated flow in ruts or ditches.  Adding gravel increases hydraulic conductivity and
 reduces erosion.  Road erosion rates can also be decreased by reducing tire pressure or by removing
 roads.  The authors are developing applications of the Water Erosion Prediction Project model as
 user-friendly erosion prediction tools for road managers.  Further work is required to quantify the 
 effects of current management techniques on water quality and to develop new low-impact road design 
 and management technology.

$Abstract=Fuel and land management activities in the past century have placed wildland values such as soil and water
 quality at greater risk due to increased soil erosion. Eroded sediment can lead to decreased long-term soil
 productivity and adversely impact aquatic ecosystems.  Higher runoff rates from severely burned landscapes
 can lead to flooding and increased risk to human life and property. Over the past ten years, we have completed
 studies on eight sites in the Northwest and Southeast U. S. measuring erosion impacts associated with
 prescribed burning. We are now carrying out field and laboratory studies addressing knowledge gaps in our
 understanding of fuel management practices on soil erosion, and developing a user-friendly computer interface
 to be able to evaluate the risk and consequences of erosion hazards following wildfires, mitigation treatments,
 and prescribed burns. Specific tasks that we are addressing include: determining hillslope characteristics
 that govern dry ravel processes such as slope steepness, vegetation density, soil texture and disturbance
 impacts; determining the spatial and temporal variability in infiltration and erosion parameters needed
 to predict overland flow and soil detachment after wildfire; quantifying effectiveness of three mitigation practices
 in reducing sediment production for specified design storms following wildfires; and evaluating measured
 erosion rates and estimates of sediment production after wildfires at the upland watershed/catchment 
 scale. Data collection has begun from a burned over catchment and preliminary results will be presented.
 Additional discussion will address methodologies and approaches to evaluate and model erosion risk and hazard.

$Abstract= A computer program can help managers anticipate erosion and sediment delivery attributed to forest roads.
 The watershed version of the water erosion prediction project (WEPP) predicts road erosion rates within
 the observed range but overestimates sediment plume lengths.  The predicted sources of
 sediment from an insloping road are mainly from the road ditch and the downslope
 channel; less sediment comes from the traveledway and the cutslope.  Mitigation
 measures to minimize ditch erosion and channel flow rates will have the greatest 
 effects on reducing sediment delivered from insloped forest roads.

	Poster.
$abstract=Erosion rates in a forest environment are generally small except
when the ground surface is disturbed by human or natural causes.
Concentrated flow can detach soil particles if the hydraulic
energy is greater than the erosion resistance of the soil.
In steep forest environments ample hydraulic energy is available to move
the sediment load down slope; thus erosion is generally limited by the
amount of detached sediment available for transport.
The objective of this study was to measure the rill erosion rates for
various surface conditions and slope steepness. 
Rills were allowed to form naturally in each of four surface conditions
[natural cover, low severity burn areas, high severity burn areas, and
skid trails] at two field sites for three replications.
Concentrated flow was projected downslope at
five discharge rates (7, 22, 15, 30, 48 l&nbsp;min<sup>-1</sup>) on
three slopes classes (20, 45, 65 %) for a 4 m length.
Timed bottle samples, velocities, and flow depths were measured for each flow rate.
Results suggest a detachment limiting condition existed with
sediment concentration decreasing with each flow discharge rate.
Calculated erosion rates were greater for the highly disturbed
surface conditions than the less-disturbed surface conditions.

$abstract=Recent fires have renewed interest in fire's effect on different components
 of the ecosystems, particularly erosion and soil productivity.
 Our objectives were to 
  (1) determine hillslope erosion rates after a high severity wildfire in an unmanaged forest stand;
  (2) determine fire's short-term effects on nutrient loss.
 The study site was within an unmanaged forest area in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Eastern Oregon. 
 The fire consumed all downed woody debris larger than 75 mm diameter and all standing 
 trees were killed. In addition the entire forest floor (duff) was consumed, leaving 
 mineral soil exposed to raindrop impact and overland flow.
 Onsite erosion measurements were conducted for four years after the wildfire. Silt 
 fences were used to collect eroded sediment on three slope classes (20, 30, and 60 percent), 
 replicated twice, all within a high severity burn area. Mean first year erosion rates were 
 1.9 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, decreasing to 0.1 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> the second year, then to 0.03 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> the third. 
 No erosion occurred the fourth year. In year one, the 60 percent slope sites produced 
 twice as much sediment as did the 20 percent slope sites. Soil nutrient losses followed 
 the same pattern as the sediment losses. High severity wildfires can produce accelerated 
 erosion and nutrient loss for the first year before establishment of natural regeneration.

$Abstract=In forest conditions, surface runoff and soil erosion are generally low because 
 of the surface litter cover. Hydraulic conductivities are in excess of 15 mm/hr, and erosion 
 rates are generally less than 0.1 Mg/ha. If the litter layer is disturbed, then runoff and 
 erosion rates can increase by several magnitudes. Disturbances can be natural, such as wild 
 fire, or human-induced, such as harvesting or prescription-burning for ecosystem management, 
 where conductivities can drop to under 5 mm/hr, and erosion rates can exceed 20 Mg/ha. Roads 
 adversely impact forest soil productivity by directly reducing the productive area, and by 
 causing the greatest amount of soil erosion. Conductivities of roads have been measured to 
 be less than 1 mm/hr, and erosion can exceed 100 Mg/ha. Harvesting activities 
 reduce surface cover and compact the soil, leading to increased runoff and erosion. 
 Erosion generally decreases productivity of forests by decreasing the available soil 
 water for forest growth, and through loss of nutrients in eroded sediment. The Water 
 Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is shown to be a useful tool in predicting the 
 erosion impacts of different levels of vegetation removal at harvest, and different levels 
 of compaction. WEPP predicted that the nutrients lost through the organic matter in 
 sediments are significant, but less than nutrient loss through tree removal. Work is 
 ongoing to collect long-term site productivity data from numerous sites to aid in the 
 analysis of forest management on soil erosion and site productivity.

$Abstract=This paper presents an analytical tool to evaluate the probability that a given 
 annual erosion rate occurs during the short period of forest disturbance from fire or 
 harvesting, as common in forest ecosystems. The paper provides an overview of the WEPP 
 model and how it is applied to complex forest conditions. It then gives a review of hydrologic 
 probability analysis methods and builds the case to support a non-parametric method. It 
 describes a new WEPP interface which allows users to easily combine the erosion prediction 
 strength of the WEPP model, the database of forest erodibility properties developed by our 
 research unit, the stochastic features of the CLIGEN climate generator, and a non-parametric 
 probability analysis of the results.

 These computer codes have been developed, tested, and validated by
 U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service researchers.
 The purpose of this research was to provide engineers and scientists 
 a personal computer program for evaluating potential slope instability
 within planning areas in forested uplands.
 Physical soil values within the infinite slope equation are evaluated
 within DLISA for possible frequency distributions.
 LISA, the probabilistic computer program, adds a stochastic simulation by
 the Monte Carlo method of these frequency distributions.
 The result from these analyses is a probabilitu of slope failure.
 Potential shallow landslides, such as debris flows, have been evaluated
 since 1987 and can be predicted with DLISA and LISA.

For every storm, WEPP calculates the infiltration and runoff, and soil detachment, transport, deposition, and delivery from the bottom of the hillside. Each day plants grow, transpire, and/or senesce, while plant residue on the soil surface accumulates and decomposes.

 The X-DRAIN model is a user-friendly computer program based on the Water Erosion Prediction
 Project (WEPP) and is designed to estimate sediment yield from roads, landings, skid trails,
 and foot trails as affected by climate, soil, local topography, and transportation system
 characteristics.
 X-DRAIN can be used to determine optimum cross drain spacing for existing or planned roads,
 and for developing and supporting recommendations concerning road construction,
 reconstruction, realignment, closure, obliteration, or mitigation efforts based on sediment yield. The
 model estimates sediment yield produced by a given road or road system by summing sediment
 quantities from each unique road segment or road length between cross drains.

 This report provides a brief background of WEPP, discusses applications of X-DRAIN, and details
 examples to assist the field user with software implementation.
 Appendix A contains instructions for installing this application on the PC.
 Included are hardware requirements, application features, and removal of the application from the PC.

$Abstract=The effect of tire pressure on sediment produced by loaded logging trucks operating on low-quality aggregate surfaced roads is analyzed. Rainfall and runoff were measured for three winter seasons with logging truck traffic. Sediment eroded from the road surface from moderately reduced tire pressure road sections averaged 45 percent less than from the highway tire pressure sections. An average reduction of 80 percent was measured from the section used by trucks operating with low tire pressure sections. Because the processes responsible for sediment reduction are not site specific, lowering tire pressures in logging trucks on unpaved roads can reduce the sediment loss from many unpaved road surfaces. The results were used to calibrate the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. Once calibrated, the model estimated the sediment reduction expected at representative locations for all national forests. The WEPP model demonstrated its ability to be helpful in estimating the sediment reduction from forest roads.

$abstract=
 Watershed applications of WEPP can predict erosion and sedimentation values for small watersheds.
 A segment of forest road with a cutslope and ditch may be modeled as a small watershed which drains through a culvert and filters down a forested hillslope.
 The purpose of this paper is to discuss how well WEPP models this type of scenario and
 whether or not the output values are a good approximation of real runoff and erosion from forest roads.
 With this information, recommendations can be made when designing or maintaining forest roads to best control erosion and soil loss.
 <br>
 The area developed for an insloping forest road consists of the cutslope, a ditch, the road, culverts spaced at certain intervals, and the hillslope below the culvert where
 sediment is carried down toward a perennial stream.
 To develop this scenario in WEPP, each element must be developed individually and then linked together in the watershed structure.

   <b>Restoration Ecology</b> 5(3) 265-270.
$Abstract=Many forest roads are being closed as a step in watershed restoration. 
 Ripping roads with subsoilers or rock rippers is a common practice to increase 
 the infiltration capacity of roads before closure. When considering the effectiveness 
 of ripping for reducing runoff and erosion and the potential reduction in slope 
 stability by saturating road fills, it is important to know how ripping changes 
 the infiltration capacity of forest roads. Hydrographs from simulated rainfall 
 on 1 X 1 m plots were analyzed to find the saturated hydraulic conductivity, an 
 indicator of infiltration capacity. I examined saturated hydraulic conductivity 
 for three treatments on two different soils. One road was built in a soil derived 
 from the metamorphic belt series geology of northern Idaho, a soil noted for 
 its high rock fragment content. The second road was built in a sandy soil 
 derived from decomposed granitics of the Idaho batholith. On each soil, five 
 plots were installed on a road before ripping, and nine plots were installed on 
 the same road segment following ripping, four covered with a heavy straw mulch 
 and five without. Three half-hour rainfall events with intensities near 90 mm/hr 
 were simulated on each plot. Results show that ripping increases hydraulic 
 conductivities enough to reduce risk of runoff but does not restore the natural 
 hydraulic conductivity of a forested slope. The unripped road surfaces had 
 hydraulic conductivities in the range of 0-4 mm/hr, whereas ripped roads
 were in the range of 20-40 mm/hr after the second event. Surface sealing 
 and tilled soil subsidence processes are important in reducing the hydraulic 
 conductivity of the soils with repeated wetting. Subsidence appears to be 
 important on the granitic soil, whereas surface sealing was more important 
 on the belt series soil.

 ASAE Paper No. 89-2621.
$abstract=To estimate the rill erodibility of a soil, it is necessary to
 relate observed erosion rates to the hydraulic shear and width of the rill channel.
 The hydraulic shear can be calculated given the hydraulic radius for a given flow condition.
 To find eroding rill channel hydraulic radii, photogrammetric and rillmeter methods were
 used in the Water Erosion Prediction Project cropland erodibility study conducted by the
 Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 The objectives of this document are to describe two methods of measuring the rill shape
 on experimental sites and to compare the resulting rill shape parameter values.
 The photogrammetric method showed larger measurements for hydraulic radii,
 with greater scatter, but allowed for the collection of more topographic data,
 and had greater flexibility than the rillmeter method.
 For the rillmeter method, the mean hydraulic radii varied from 6.2 to 14.3 mm with a 95% confidence interval of +/-4.0 mm.
 For the photogrammetric method, the hydraulic radii varied from 10.2 to 25.6 mm with a 95% confidence limit of +/-9.4 mm.
 We concluded that for a study of this scope, the photogrammetric technology with the
 capability of providing considerably more site data is the preferred method.
 We also concluded that a rillmeter backup is desirable, rather than relying on a single measurement technology.

$abstract=
 In a forest environment, soil erosion can lead to sedimentation which can adversely affect the health of stream channels and reservoirs.
 It has been estimated that in forests between 30 and 100% of the sediment budget comes from surface erosion.
 Less than 10% of the surface erosion is from interrill or raindrop impacts,
 whereas over 90% of the erosion is from rills and gullies.

	Ph.D. dissertation. Moscow, ID: University of Idaho.
$abstract=Considerable attention has been focused on the impacts of forest management decisions on
the environment in recent decades. Burning after timber harvest is a common site
preparation technique and its effect on soil erosion is of increasing concern, particularly
on steep terrain. The effects of burning are not uniformly distributed on a hillslope.
Methods are needed to assess the soil erosion potential on spatially-varied hillslopes so
that the risk of adverse effects of management activities on water quality and aquatic
habitat can be evaluated. This study presents a method to address the spatially-varied
surface conditions usually found after a prescribed fire, and their influence on erosion. A
laboratory study determined the factors that influence hydrophobicity, and a method to
model the hydrophobicity effect was developed. Field studies were conducted to
determine the spatially-varied effects of fire, and rainfall simulation was used to
determine infiltration and erodibility parameters for various surface conditions.
Hydrophobic soil conditions after fire occurred more often in dry coarse textured soils
than in fine textured soils. A hydrophobicity index that reduced the hydraulic
conductivity based on the soil texture and soil heating was developed. A forest ground
cover factor based on duff thickness was developed. The amount of duff material
remaining after a fire was the most important factor affecting erosion. As the amount of
duff material remaining increases, erosion decreases. The amount of duff remaining and
management activities were used to determine four different surface conditions after the
fire. Probability distribution functions of the important factors that influence erosion
were developed. A method to model spatially-varied hillslope conditions based on the
sequential simulation techniques is presented.

$Abstract=The sediment production from highway tire pressures, constant reduced tire pressures, 
 and from central tire inflation tire pressures on loaded logging trucks operating on a marginal 
 quality aggregate surfaced road were compared. Rainfall and runoff were measured for three winter 
 seasons with logging truck traffic. Sediment production from the constant reduced tire pressure 
 road sections averaged 45% less than from the highway tire pressure sections. An average savings 
 of 80% was measured from the central tire inflation system tire pressure sections. These results 
 were used to calibrate a physical-process-based erosion model, WEPP. Once calibrated, the model
 was used to estimate the sediment reduction expected at two locations in the United States, one 
 in Brazil, and one in Romania. Since the processes that are responsible for the sediment reduction 
 are not site specific and were modeled by WEPP, we feel confident that lowering tire pressures in 
 logging trucks on unpaved roads can reduce the sediment loss from these road surfaces. 
 The WEPP model can be helpful in estimating the sediment reduction.

$Abstract=In many National Forests, much watershed restoration work involves road removal.
 Most National Forests have more roads than can be maintained with decreased budgets limiting the amount of roads
 that can be removed in any given year.
 Setting priorities for road closure based on the impacts and risks involved in closing, removing, or discontinuing
 maintenance has become a major challenge for forest managers.
 Stability and erosion risks are associated with unmaintained roads, and the same risks are associated with various
 removal strategies, such as culvert removal, surface ripping, outsloping, and recontouring.
 Preliminary studies show that effectiveness of ripping depends on soil texture.
 Culvert failure can lead to road fill instability and failure of catastrophic proportions.
 The WEPP model may be a useful tool for evaluating road-closure options to minimize off-site sedimentation.
 Recontouring the surface without considering long-term subsurface flow impacts may greatly decrease slope stability,
 but well-engineered recontouring will minimize stability risk as well as erosion.

$abstract=
 Natural erosion and sedimentation in forest streams help keep the streams functioning properly.
 However, forest development, harvest, and management require roads to be built and maintained,
 and these roads may create excess sediment.
 Erosion from roads has become a greater concern as forests are developed and as the demand for
 forest management increases.
 Sediment added from these human activities can be harmful to natural stream habitats.
 <br>
 There are many techniques for reducing erosion and sediment transport on roads.
 Graveling travelways, installing water bars or cross drains, and establishing riparian buffer
 zones are usually the most cost effective.
 Field tests have shown that spacing recommendations for these types of controls should be
 based on soil type, topography, road dimensions, road aspect, and climate.
 Therefore, design recommendations for these controls cannot be made on a nationwide or statewide level.

$abstract=
 Disturbed forest lands are prone to increased erosion.
 Predicting the effects of forest operations on surface hydrology and erosion is difficult.
 Hydrologic models have been developed for agricultural conditions, but they may not be valid in forests.
 The WEPP model, a process-based erosion model under development, may have limitations in modeling erosion in forest areas.
 Field research has shown that timber harvest area soil properties may vary widely.
 Validation studies with the Watershed Version of the WEPP model show that as observed, snow melt
 dominates the runoff processes in the Northern Rockies, and that disturbed areas generally have
 a greater influence on runoff and erosion than do undisturbed areas.
 The model overpredicted snow melt rate, and did not allow snow to accumulate, but rather melted any
 accumulation on the first day that was above freezing following a snow event.
 It may be necessary to reduce hydraulic conductivities from those observed on small field plots to obtain runoff.
 A model that better describes the attributes of this region's snowmelt processes and upland hydrology is needed.
 Additional research is also needed for modeling the large spatial variability observed in timber harvest areas.
 Research is ongoing to address all of these forest-specific problems.

$abstract=Debates have been raging in recent years over the benefits of road closure.
 Road closure is an increasingly common practice to achieve a variety of management
 goals including improvement of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and reduction of casual
 human effects on forest environments.
 As with road construction, however, there are some major hydrologic considerations that
 must be considered. 
 The construction and use of a road severely disturbs the soil, increasing runoff rates,
 reducing subsurface water flows, and altering shallow groundwater equilibrium.
 Unfortunately, information needed to understand road prism effects on surface and
 subsurface hydrology is limited.

$Abstract=Several logging road subgrades and cut slopes failed under wet
 conditions in the 1980's on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.
 Although standard laboratory soil test results did not indicate this
 would occur, field tests showed possible soil failure.
 A majority of these soils were coarse-grained with significant amounts of
 fines (silt and clay).
 Field soil identification methods indicated that these soils had a
 moisture content above the plastic limit; the laboratory test results
 were mostly non-plastic.
 During construction, the soils performed like plastic soils with low
 strength values, although in the laboratory the soils had suitable
 strength values for normal road construction methods.
 An hypothesis that standard laboratory tests for soil strength values do
 not detect organic and/or clay minerals that lead to failure under wet
 road construction conditions on the Olympic Peninsula was proven correct.
 A combined field and laboratory testing procedure was developed for
 identifying these soils.

$Abstract=Erosion rates of recently graded nongravel forest roads were measured under rainfall 
 simulation on five different soils. The erosion rates observed on 24 forest road erosion plots 
 were compared with values predicted by the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Model, Version 
 93.1. Hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility values were predicted from methods developed for 
 rangeland and cropland soils. It was found that on four of the five soils, runoff values were closely 
 predicted and that the predicted erosion was not significantly different from the observed erosion 
 when using rangeland methods for predicting soil erodibility. It was also found that interrill 
 erosion rates were underpredicted using rangeland methods for predicting soil erodibility, but 
 slightly overpredicted when using cropland interrill erodibility prediction methods. Rill erosion 
 rates for road wheel ruts were closely predicted from rangeland rill erodibility algorithms.

 There is an increased awareness of the importance of maintaining the global ecosystem with 
 all its biologic diversity. The USDA Forest Service manages large areas of the nation�s forestlands 
 and has an ongoing commitment to apply the best technology available in its management processes. 
 One of the areas of concern in the forest ecosystem is the amount of sediment eroded from forest roads
 into waterways that serve as spawning and rearing habitats for fish and as habitats for aquatic 
 macroinvertebrates. The authors have been participating in the development of the Water Erosion 
 Prediction Project (WEPP), a major interagency research and model development project. The major 
 thrust of the WEPP project has been to predict soil erosion for agricultural and rangeland conditions. 
 Further research is being conducted to apply the WEPP model to forest roads and harvest areas.

 Additional research is also needed for modeling the large spatial variability observed in timber harvest areas.

        Committee on the Water Resources Engineering Division/ASCE, Aug 14-16,1995, San Antonio, TX.
$abstract=Rainfall simulators are commonly used to estimate erodibility parameters for physically-based erosion models.
 Rainfall produced by the simulators should have kinetic energy delivery rates comparable to
 natural rainfall and the kinetic energy field under the simulator should be uniform.
 We used a calibrated piezoelectric crystal-based instrument to measure the raindrop splash
 power of a modified Purdue rainfall simulator.
 Measurements were taken at several points for three intensities (30, 50, and 100 mm/hr) and
 on a large grid at an intensity of 50 mm/hr.
 Raindrop power varied linearly from 0.116 W/m<sup>2</sup> at a rainfall intensity of 30 mm/hr
 to 0.391 W/m<sup>2</sup> at an intensity of 100 mm/hr, about half of that theoretically
 predicted for natural rainfall.
 On a closely spaced grid under 50mm/hr rainfall, power varied from 0.103 W/m<sup>2</sup> to
 0.292 W/m<sup>2</sup>, a ratio of 1:3.
 The difference between the measured power and the power of natural rainfall and the high
 variability in the kinetic energy field raises questions about the validity of erodibility
 values derived from the simulator.
 Further testing of the piezoelectric crystal instrument will help validate these results.

$abstract=
 Aggregate is placed on forest roads in wet climates to provide structural support for
 traffic and in dry climates to reduce sediment production caused by precipitation.
 In both climates aggregate of suitable quality is often not readily available.
 The substitution of poorer-quality aggregate can cause greater amounts of sediment
 than that produced by good-quality aggregate.
 To measure the differences in sedimentation rates, the Forest Service of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture conducted a sediment study using two aggregate qualities.
 The study was conducted using natural rainfall and logging truck traffic on an
 aggregate-surfaced road during the winters of 1992 and 1993 in western Oregon and
 using simulated rainfall following the winter of 1993.
 The results showed that the quality of the aggregate made a notable difference in
 sediment production.

$abstract=The use of lowered tire pressures has the capability
 to reduce sediment production from unpaved forest roads.
 A three year test of Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS) and Constant Reduced Pressure (CRP) methods to
 achieve lowered tire pressures was conducted by the US Forest Service.
 The average sediment reduction from the use of CTIS was 80% compared to highway tire pressures.
 When using CRP tire pressures, the average sediment reduction was 45% compared to highway tire pressures.
 Both lowered tire pressure systems had shallower, less well defined wheel ruts resulting in less
 frequent road maintenance requirements.

$authorblock=Elliot, Foltz, Robichaud
$Abstract=The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is
developing a process-based model of rainfall-runoff and sediment erosion
on disturbed forest sites, principally forest roads and timber harvest
areas. The basis of the developing model is the Water Erosion Prediction
Project (WEPP) model developed for agriculture and rangelands. The major
challenges in adapting this model to mountainous forest conditions are
differences in parameter estimation techniques, weather prediction,
vegetation effects, and management activities. Simulated and natural
rainfall experiments are used for parameter estimations from forest roads
and timber harvest areas. Several model components and parameter
estimations from field and laboratory experiments are discussed.

$abstract=Roads are a major source of sediment in most forests. The WEPP model is a process-based soil
 erosion model that may be applied to such forest roads. Example applications of the WEPP model to
 different road/stream configurations were presented.
 The WEPP model shows considerable promise in assisting ecosystem managers to predict the

$abstract=Slash burning is a common site preparation technique used after timber harvest throughout the Southeastern
 United States.
 Little quantitative information exists on the hydrologic response to burn severity.
 This study compared the effects of low-severity and high-severity burns on runoff and sediment yields
 during rainfall simulation and during natural rainfall in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.
 Fire severity was largely determined by moisture conditions of the forest floor prior to ignition.
 Runoff and sediment yield variability was high between plots within the same treatment area due to
 differences in forest floor characteristics and infiltration rates.
 Conditions of high-severity resulted when burning was conducted with relatively dry fuels.
 Sediment yields were 40-times greater for the high-severity treatment areas than the low-severity treatment areas.

$abstract=Postharvest residue burning is a common site preparation treatment used in the interior Northwest to reduce forest fuels and
  prepare sites for tree regeneration.
  A study was conducted to measure runoff, sediment production, and nutrient changes caused by broadcast burning of logging slash.
  The site was a northern Idaho mixed conifer forest of western hemlock, grand fir, western white pine, western larch and Douglas-fir.
  A spring burn (1992) consumed about 50 percent of the litter, 22 percent of the humus, and 79 percent of the woody fuels less than 8 cm in diameter.
  Heat penetration into the mineral soil was minimal due to moisture present in the lower duff and mineral soil.
  Temperatures at the mineral soil surface did not exceed 77<sup>o</sup>C.
  Four replications of three, 30-minute simulated rainfall events (50 mm/hr) were used.
  Low erosion rates and nutrient losses were measured from this burn treatment.
  These results could help in making land management decisions concerning timing of burning as related
   to onsite sediment production, fuel reduction and long-term site productivity.

 <br><br>
USDA.s Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) was initiated to predict sheet and rill erosion and
to calculate annual sediment production on crop and rangelands. WEPP has been developed to
replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation. Efforts are under way to extrapolate the WEPP cropland
and rangeland model to forest areas. The development of a weather simulator is described, which
will be capable of estimating weather parameters without nearby weather records. Model
parameterization is described for road construction and timber harvest, based on field
experiments. Parameters being addressed include: runoff flow in wheel ruts and drainage ditches;
the effects of gravel surfaces, mulches on fillslopes, rock blankets in drainage ditches, and tire
pressure; and the effects of site preparation on the residual root mass.

$Abstract=Information about differences in surface conditions on timber harvest hillslopes is 
 important for hydrologic modeling. We measured and compared saturated hydraulic conductivity 
 and interrill erodibility values for different conditions found on timber harvest sites. Plots 
 with different surface conditions were subjected to three simulated rainfall events. Conditions
 sampled included bladed skid roads with and without treatments, many pass skid trails, few pass 
 skid trails, low burn severity harvest sites, high burn severity harvest sites, and undisturbed forest.
 Results suggest these conditions can be divided into two or three groups for modeling purposes.

$authorblock=
$Abstract=A method to develop erodibility prediction equations was developed
 and tested using published data.
 Published sediment yield data for 21 California forest soils developed using
 laboratory plots subjected to simulated rainfall were used to develop an
 equation that explains 90% of the variation in sediment yield from the plots.
 The predicted sediment yield values can be considered an index of relative
 interrill erodibility because only soil type varied among the plots.
 Sediment yield was a function primarily of soil texture for soils with less
 than 50% Si+Cl content.
 Beyong 50% Si+Cl content, the erodibilityof the soil related more to the type
 of clay: kaolin or smectite.
 The hypothesis proposed to explain the shape of the curve is based on
 aggregate strength under rainfall.
 A second hypothesis that increased silt and clay increases the degree of aggregation of the soil as a whole is rejected.
 Soils with a relatively high smectite clay content had a reduced aggregate
 strength and higher sediment yield when exposed to rainfall than soils with a
 relatively high kaolin clay content.
 The relationship of texture and clay mineral content to erodibility should be
 general and applicable to other soils.

$Abstract=Many existing pseudo-random number generators in commercial software and textbooks are bad.
 I studied the literature to compare methods used in generators of various
 distribution types, and compiled a set of "good" functions which return pseudo-random
 independent sequences of numbers fitting the
   standard uniform,
   triangular,
   general normal,
   lognormal,
   exponential and
   beta distributions.
 They have a consistent calling convention, are intended to be portable
 across hardware and software,
 are coded in a high-level language, produce theoretically defensible
 results and
 allow easy splitting of the sequences into disjoint subsequences.
 <br><br>
 I have described the computational model and given algorithms in BASIC
 for each distribution type.
 Discussion of each distribution type also includes a review of other
 generation methods.
 A test result is given in the comments of the code for each generator to
 help the user ensure that
 the routines have been implemented correctly on his or her system.
 <br><br>
 Plots of running values of mean and variance from returned sequences of 2
 to 600 values for each generator
 show visually the sensitivity of the generators to number of samples.
 These plots for the uniform generator for different seed values also show
 its sensitivity to seed value.
 <br><br>
 The pseudo-random uniform generator routine is also coded in APL, C, and FORTRAN.

$authorblock=
$Abstract=Runoff and sediment production was measured under simulated and natural rain from 1x5 m plots
 established on a cutover and burned mixed pine-hardwood site in the Georgia Piedmont.
 Trees on the study site were cut and removed without mechanical disturbance.
 Slash was removed, kiln dried and replaced on the slope, and burned prior to plot installation.
 Three slopes, two rainfall intensities, three rainfall simulations representing
 three soil moisture conditions, and two replicate plots were used.
 The experiment was repeated four times during the period July 1989-July 1990
 to investigate the effects of temporal changes in surface conditions and
 particularly root mat and residual forest floor decomposition.
 Runoff and sediment production from natural rainfall events was also measured
 from these plots from the period February-October 1990.
 Results of all measurements indicate that runoff and sediment production
 were generally low because of the protection afforded by the residual forest
 floor following burning.
 However, temporary hydrophobic conditions caused by a dry organic layer
 produced relatively high runoff rates and high sediment for the first few
 minutes of runoff for some of the simulated rainfall applications.

$authorblock=
$Abstract=Two 100-ft forest road section (plots) were bladed and used to measure
sediment production from a loaded logging truck using normal (95 psi) tire pressure
on one section and reduced (70 psi for steering axle and 50 psi elsewhere) tire
pressure on the other. Each insloped road plot was divided lengthwise into two
subplots 100 feet long by 5.7 feet wide to define one wheel track. Three
simulated rainstorms at a rate of 2 inches per hour for 30 minutes each were
applied to each plot before truck travel and three more were applied after truck
travel. Increases in sediment production (kg) from the normal tire pressure
plot ranged from +8% (dry run) to +121% (wet run) for the three rainfall
applications, with an average value of +67%, compared to the reduced tire
pressure plot. Increases in sediment concentration from the normal tire 
pressure plot ranged from +32% (dry run) to +132% (very wet run) for the three
rainfall applications, with an average value of +74%, compared to the reduced
tire pressure plot. These increases in sediment production and sediment
concentration were caused by more concentrated flow, with more erosive power, in
the deeper ruts formed in the normal tire pressure plot.  Soil moisture contents
for 3 of the 4 subplots were greater than the optimum for compaction, but the
higher ground pressures on the normal tire pressure plot caused significant
rutting while the road surface of the reduced tire pressure plot had only minor
ruts.  These tests clearly indicate that the use of VTP has a significant
potential to reduce adverse impcts on water quality.

$Abstract=This study was undertaken to measure sediment production from bounded forest road plots using
simulated rainfall. Runoff and sediment were collected from two paired plots exposed to simulated
rainfall. One plot contained a wheel rut while the other one did not. These two different plots were
used to determine the effects of shallow concentrated flow on the amount of sediment produced.
Sediment production rates from these plots on native surfaced roads are presented. The mean soil
diameter ranged from 0.80 mm to 0.05 mm. Sediment rates on the rutted plots with concentrated
flow ranged from 1300 kg/ha/mm to 300 kg/ha/mm for the 30-minute, 50-mm/hr intensity. Rates
on the freshly graded plots without ruts ranged from 700 kg/ha/mm to 100 kg/ha/mm. A process
based model of sediment armoring, believed to be a major process occurring on unpaved forest
roads, was developed and tested using the information collected from eight sites over a period of
three years.

$abstract=Forest land management activities in the United States have extended and accelerated in the past
 four decades into steep, mountainous lands, and into more economically and environmentally
 marginal operating situations.
 Also, increasing environmental awareness over the last 25 years
 has focused considerable attention on the potential impacts of any forest-based activity upon the
 environment. Of particular concern is soil loss leading to reduction of future forest productive
 capacity, water quality degradation, damage to aquatic ecosystems, and visual degradation.
 In many parts of the nation, particularly the Pacific Northwest, forest land managers have found that
 their management alternatives are constrained by limits on turbidity and sediment concentration
 allowed in receiving streams.
 It is essential that managers have the means to predict, with
 acceptable accuracy, sediment production from alternative road construction and maintenance
 plans and alternative harvest area treatment practices.
  <br><br>
 In 1986, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, initiated the Water
 Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) for use on croplands and rangelands to replace the Universal
 Soil Loss Equation.
 The Forest Service joined the WEPP effort because of our interest in estimating sediment production from disturbed forest lands.
 The WEPP model cannot be used in its present form on forest sites because of the many hydrologic and erosion conditions
 that are not considered in the cropland WEPP model.
 The goal of our work is to develop physical process
 models of onsite runoff and sediment production for use on forest roads and timber harvest areas
 nationwide. To do this, we must develop algorithms to estimate model parameters using easily
 measured site characteristics from field sites across the nation. This "forest model" will become
 an integral part of the general WEPP model.
  <br><br>
 Observations and experience by forest land managers and technical specialists nationwide indicate
 that forest roads are the greatest single source of sediment delivered to receiving streams.
 Probably the greatest volume of sediment produced from Alaska to California and the northern
 and central Rocky Mountains comes from mass erosion associated with forest road construction
 and maintenance.
 A lesser volume comes from surface erosion on the forest road prism, and a
 much smaller volume from landslides and surface erosion on timber harvest areas. Fall and winter
 rains, and spring snowmelt runoff in the west, provide ample energy for surface erosion.

$abstract=The United States Forest Service is developing a surface erosion model for disturbed forest sites,
 principally forest roads and timber harvest areas.
 Simulated rainfall is used on bounded plots of various sizes to generate runoff and sediment production from a wide range of soil textures and land management situations.
 The usual sequence of rainfall at a selected intensity is a 30-minute application with the soil in a dry condition, followed 24-hours later by a second application, then followed as soon as possible by a third.
 Two rainfall intensities are used on forest roads: 25 mm/hr and 51 mm/hr.
 Several rainfall intensities are used on timber harvest sites, ranging from 51 mm/hr to 102 mm/hr.
 Data from simulated rainfall on small field plots, burned and unburned, with and without the residual root mat removed, showed the increases in sediment yield to be expected from severe slash treatment/site preparation burns.
 Field plots on timber harvest areas that were unburned and burned with and without machine compaction provided data on the effects of these treatments under natural rainfall conditions.
 Results of a laboratory study of the hydraulic roughness of overland sheet flow with rainfall and a field study of the hydraulics of concentrated flow in wheel ruts were used in an analytic model of runoff from forest roads.
 Data from a laboratory study of the relative erodibility of wildland soils were used to estimate interrill sediment detachment as a function of soil texture and clay mineralogy.
 Simulated rainfall on bounded road plots up to 38 m long showed that wheel ruts increased sediment production by a factor of two to four over similar unrutted road sections.
 The difference in the increase was a function of relative soil erodibility.

  Each insloped road treatment
  area was divided lengthwise into two plots 30 m long by 1.74 m wide to define one wheel track.
  Three simulated rainstorms at a rate of 50 mm/hour for 30 minutes each were applied to each plot
  before truck travel, and three more were applied after truck travel.
  The tire pressure ranged from
  1.07 times (dry run) to 2.20 times (wet run) for the three rainfall applications, with an average
  value of 1.60. The similar ratio for sediment concentration ranged from 1.31 times (dry run ) to
  2.31 times (very wet run) for the three rainfall applications, with an average value of 1.71.
  These increases in sediment yield and sediment concentration were caused by more concentrated flow,
  with more erosive power, in the deeper ruts formed in the normal tire pressure treatment area.
  Soil moisture contents for three of the four plots were greater than the optimum for compaction,
  but the higher ground pressures on the normal tire pressure treatment area caused deeper rutting
  while the road surface of the reduced tire pressure treatment area had only minor ruts.
  These tests clearly indicate that the use of reduced tire pressure has a significant potential to reduce
  adverse impacts on water quality.

$Abstract=Evaluating the stability of variable landforms is important for land management planning on forest lands in the western United States and Alaska.
This paper describes a rational means for considering both natural variability and measurement uncertainty in landslide hazard evaluation of both natural slopes, and constructed cut and fill slopes.
Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate the frequency distribution of the factor of safety on a given landform or slope.
The probability of failure is taken as the relative frequency with which the factors of safety are less than or equal to one.
The simulation program is written for IBM PCs and compatibles, includes a menu-driven user interface, and allows the use of seven different input probability distributions to describe the natural variability and uncertainty of each input variable.

$Abstract=A non-contact ultrasonic profiler was developed to
 measure soil surface roughness. The profiler has a vertical
 accuracy of ± 3 mm, a horizontal resolution of 30 mm, and
 detects the highest point in a 2040 mm^ ± 1 6 0 mm^
 circular scan area. The profiler provides a convenient, noncontact
 means of accurately determining surface roughness
 parameters.
 <br><br>
 Surface elevations were measured to evaluate changes
 in random roughness of three tillage treatments (chisel
 plow, moldboard plow, and field cultivator) with simulated
 rainfall. Random roughness decreased with rainfall.
 Consolidation of 30 to 50 mm occurred on all three
 treatments. Horizontal soil movement occurred on the
 chisel and moldboard treatments from the tillage tool
 ridges to the furrows. A decrease of approximately 60 mm
 of total relief was observed with soil lost from the ridges
 being deposited into the furrow. However, no such
 movement was observed in the field cultivator treatment.
 These results were consistent with earlier results obtained
 using a manually operated profiler.

$Abstract=A continuing Forest Service research effort to study onsite sediment yield from
 forest lands provides information on the relative erodibility of certain geologic parent 
 materials and methods to reduce surface erosion. Simulated rainfall on bounded plots is the
 principal research tool to generate runoff and sediment yield from selected sites. This technique
 is also used to measure the reduction in sediment yield as a percentage of that from an
 unprotected site. Two types of disturbed forest sites are being studied: forest roads and
 timber harvest sites.
  <br><br>
 Graphs are provided to estimate the amount of erosion reduction by selected treatments on road
 cutslopes and fillslopes. Percentage ground cover is the principal variable to reduce surface
 erosion. Where data are available, graphs show estimations of the application rate necessary to
 provide the required amount of ground cover for a selected percentage erosion reduction. For
 some treatments, erosion reduction is also a function of slope gradient and silt content in the
 surface soil. In these cases, an erosion reduction treatment is less effective for steeper slopes and
 siltier soils.
  <br><br>
 The net result of controlling erosion on the various components of the forest road is not the sum,
 or product, of the percentage erosion reduction for each component. Research results are used
 to partition sediment yield from a 100-foot road section consisting of a running surface, ditch,
 and cutslope. This partitioning shows the expected decrease in sediment yield as each
 component of the road is protected, taking into account the contribution from the other
 components. A procedure is presented to design a rock blanket for the road ditch as a function
 of the expected discharge, slope, and ditch shape.

 soil erodibility study. During the two summers, 35 cropland sites scattered across 26 states were visited with a
 large field crew and a rotating boom rainfall simulator. The purpose of the study was to determine soil rill and
 interrill erodibility and hydraulic conductivity, and to relate those values to more easily measured soil properties.
 A detailed description of the research methods, raw data, and data analysis were summarized in a compendium.

$Publisher=ASCE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Simulated rainfall was used to generate runoff and sediment yield
 from forest roads and fillslopes built in granitic soils to test the
 effectiveness of various surfacing materials, mulches, and barriers as
 erosion control treatments. An empirical equation is presented and used to
 estimate the relative effectiveness of gravel, dust oil, and bituminous
 surface treatments in reducing sediment yield relative to that of an
 unsurfaced road. The equation uses road grade, surface density, and the D<sub>50</sub>
 of loose soil on the surface to predict sediment yield from unsurfaced roads.
 Gravel, dust oil, and bituminous surfacing reduce sediment yield by factors
 of 4.3, 7.7, and 91 relative to the sediment yield for a comparable
 unsurfaced road. Dense grass cover (97 percent) on 1.5:1 fillslopes reduces
 sediment yield by 99.6 percent of that from a bare slope with a loose soil
 surface. Wood fiber mulch and a sediment barrier of cull logs and logging
 slash reduce bare slope sediment yield by 91 and 87 percent, respectively.

$authorblock=<b>Edward R. Burroughs, Jr.</b>
$abstract= The landslide hazard rating system for shallow soils on steep terrain over hard sandstone has three components: ground water response to precipitation, soil shear strength (including root strength), and a factor of safety model. Ground water rise over a hyperbolic-shaped bedrock surface in debris avalanche terrain is empirically derived as a function of easily measured site characteristics. Data on soil shear strength (� and c) are based on triaxial tests on samples from sites with a high potential for translational failure. Root strength is the sum of the residual strength of Douglas-fir roots as they decline with time after clearcutting and the passive resistance to sliding of an alder soil-root mass. Driving and resisting forces are calculated for a three-dimensional block using estimated ground water rise for a selected design storm, soil shear strength, and estimated root strength.

$Title=Relative effectiveness of fillslope treatments in reducing surface erosion, Horse Creek Road, Nezperce National Forest, Idaho
$Year=1984
$Authors=Burroughs, King
$category=road erosion
$Publisher=USDA FS
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Two 70-foot long segments of a 1-1/2:1 fillslope, constructed on
 "border zone" soils, were subjected to repeated simulated rainfall events.
 Water and sediment yield were monitored for a total of 20 runs.
 For each run, about 0.8 inch of precipitation was applied in 23-30 minutes
 with a kinetic energy estimated at about 60% of the energy associated with
 a natural event of this intensity.
 <br><br>
 Both fillslope plots had an existing 6-year old stand of planted
 vegetation consisting primarily of orchard grass, smooth brome, timothy,
 and Idaho fescue.  Aerial cover on plot 1 was 97.1% and the weight per unit
 area of vegetal material was 2.67 tons per acre, with litter comprising 63%
 of the dry weight biomass.  On plot 2 aerial cover was 76.7% and the weight
 per unit area of vegetal material was 1.47 tons per acre, with litter
 comprising 51% of the biomass.
 <br><br>
 Four rainfall applications were made on plot 1 in a vegetates condition
 (three runs on plot 2).
 THe vegetation and sod were stripped from the plot, followed by four
 rainfall applications on the bare soil plot (only one run on plot 2).
 An additional four rainfall application were made on plot 1, protected
 with a wood fiber mulch which provided 80.6% aerial cover, and again with
 a slash filter windrow.
 The windrow provided essentially complete cover on the lower half of the
 fillslope, while the upper half of the slope was in a bare soil condition.
 <br><br>
 In their vegetated condition, plots 1 and 2 respectively reduced sediment
 yields by 99.55% and 99.46% compared to the sediment yields from the bare plots.
 The wood fiber mulch reduced sediment yield by 91% and the slash filter
 windrow reduced sediment yield by 87%.
 <br><br>
 Both the wood fiber mulch and the filter windrow provide good immediate
 protection of the fillslopes following construction until planted grass
 can become established.
 Once fillslopes become well vegetated, sediment yields are reduced to about
 0.5% of thoose from bare slopes.
 <br><br>
 THis study does not reflect the type of detachment and transport processes
 occurring during natural rainstorms or snowmelt.
 Therefore, these data should not be used to extrapolate to seasonal or annual
 sediment production.
 The estimates of relative effectiveness of the fillslope treatments in
 reducing sediment yields are probably realistic for the granitic "border zone"
 materials in the Northern Rocky Mountains.

$authorblock=
$Abstract=
 Over much of the northwestern United States, easily accessed timber stands
 have been roaded and many of the remaining timber stands are on steep sites
 with fragile soils where watershed and fishery values are high.
 Although erosion control is an important consideration in forest road
 construction, we have limited capability to estimate sediment yield from
 forest roads or to evaluate the effectiveness of erosion control treatments.
 This paper describes a series of studies on this subject conducted
 cooperatively by the Engineering Research Project, Intermountain Forest and
 Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and
 the Civil Engineering Department, University of Idaho. The ultimate goal of
 this research effort is to develop technology for engineers to design
 cost-effective erosion control treatments for forest roads.
 <br><br>
 Several runoff and sediment yield models are available for adaptation to the
 forest road situation. These are: Road Sediment (ROSED) (Simons and others
 1977, 1979; Li 1979), which is a detailed process model; and Simplified Road
 Sediment (SIRSED) (Simons and others 1976), which is a simplified version of
 ROSED. Required input data for these models is the geometry of the proposed
 road, expected climatic events, and several soils characteristics.
 ROSED and SIRSED require field calibration to relate site characteristics to
 parameters used in each model. These models may be calibrated by instrumenting
 road sections to record rainfall, runoff, and sediment yield. This approach
 is expensive and subject to the vagaries of the weather, and will require
 several years of operation to accumulate a reliable data set.

$Abstract=Simulated rainfall events were applied to selected sections of
 mine haul roads to generate surface runoff and sediment for testing of
 ROSED (<b>Ro</b>ad <b>Sed</b>iment Model). ROSED is a process-oriented runoff and
 erosion prediction model developed at Colorado State University.
 Parameter needs for ROSED determined the format for collection of
 field data
 <br><br>
 A definite improvement in sediment prediction accuracy was obtained
 by modifying model input to simulate wheel ruts, where applicable, in
 addition to the side ditch. Total runoff volume could be predicted
 within +/-20 percent for 75 percent of the rainfall events, and runoff
 peak flow within +/-10 percent for 67 percent of these events. Total
 sediment yield could be predicted within +/-25 percent for 62 percent of
 the rainfall events.
 <br><br>
 Recommendations for improved field techniques for road erosion
 studies include: additional rain gages outside the plot boundary for
 more accurate rainfall distribution maps; and multiple event marker
 equipment to record beginning and ending of rainfall and runoff,
 rainfall intensity, and dye travel time all on a common time base.
 <br><br>
 Recommendations for future investigations with ROSED include:
 simulation of more complex runoff surfaces, such as wheel ruts; adjustment
 of model parameters for simulated snowmelt and rainfall with low
 kinetic energy; relationship of hydraulic roughness parameters to site
 characteristics; and the relationship of infiltration paramenters to
 easily measured site characteristics.

$Abstract=Numbers of roots per unit area of soil and the individual
 root tensile strength for two varieties of Douglas-fir --
 Coast fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) in western Oregon and
 Rocky Mountain fir (var. <i>glauca</i>) in central Idaho --
 decreased rapidly with time after felling.
 Seventy-five percent of the Douglas-fir roots 1 cm or smaller in diameter
 were lost within 24 months after felling in the coastal variety,
 and within 60 months after felling in the Rocky Mountain variety.
 <br><br>
 Numbers of roots per unit area of soil were combined with tensile
 strength of individual roots to estimate total tensile strength per unit
 area of soil.
 Total tensile strength declined from about 1,700 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
 to about 230 kg/m<sup>2</sup> within the first 30 months after felling for roots
 1&nbsp;cm and smaller of the Coast Douglas-fir.
 Total tensile strength
 declined from about 850 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to about 300 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the same time
 period and root size class of the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir.
 Coast Douglas-fir roots are stronger than those of the Rocky Mountain
 variety, but decay faster.
 Live strength is a characteristic of the
 variety of fir, but differences in decay rates are probably a function
 of climate.
