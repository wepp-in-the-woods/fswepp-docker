$Abstract=We synthesized post-fire road treatment information to assist BAER specialists in making road rehabilitation decisions.
 We developed a questionnaire; conducted 30 interviews of BAER team engineers and hydrologists; acquired and analyzed gray
 literature and other relevant publications; and reviewed road rehabilitation procedures and analysis tools.
 Post-fire road treatments are implemented if the values at risk warrant the treatment and based on regional
 characteristics, including the timing of first damaging storm and window of implementation.
 Post-fire peak flow estimation is important when selecting road treatments.
 Interview results indicate that USGS methods are used for larger watersheds (&gt;5 mi<sup>2</sup>)
 and NRCS Curve Number methods are used for smaller watersheds (&lt;5 mi<sup>2</sup>).
 These methods are not parameterized and validated for post-fire conditions.
 Many BAER team members used their own rules to determine parameter values for USGS regression and NRCS CN methods;
 therefore, there is no consistent way to estimate postfire peak flow.
 Many BAER road treatments for individual stream crossings were prescribed based on road/culvert surveys,
 without considering capacities of existing road structure and increased post-fire peak flow.
 For all regions, rolling dips/water bars, culvert upgrading, and ditch cleaning/armoring are the most frequently
 used road treatments.
 For Forest Service Regions 1 and 4, culvert upgrading is preferred, especially for fish-bearing streams.
 For Forest Service Region 3, culvert removal with temporary road closure and warning signs is preferred.
 Except for culverts, insufficient data is available on other road treatments to estimate their capacity and
 to evaluate their effectiveness.

$Abstract=Fugitive dust from eroding land poses risks to environmental quality and human health, and thus,
 is regulated nationally based on ambient air quality standards for particulate matter with mean aerodynamic diameter
 &le; 10 &micro;m (PM<sub>10</sub>) established in the Clean Air Act.
 Agricultural straw has been widely used for rainfall-induced erosion control;
 however, its performance for wind erosion mitigation has been less studied,
 in part because straw is mobile at moderate wind velocities.
 A wood-based long-strand material has been developed for rainfall-induced erosion control and has shown operational
 promise for control of wind-induced erosion and dust emissions from disturbed sites.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of both agricultural straw and wood-strand materials in
 controlling wind erosion and fugitive dust emissions under laboratory conditions.
 Wind tunnel tests were conducted to compare wood strands of several geometries to agricultural wheat straw and bare soil
 in terms of total sediment loss, PM<sub>10</sub> vertical flux, and PM<sub>10</sub> loss.
 Results indicate that the types of wood strands tested are stable at wind speeds of up to 18 m s<sup>-1</sup>,
 while wheat straw is only stable at speeds of up to 6.5 m s<sup>-1</sup>.
 Wood strands reduced total sediment loss and PM<sub>10</sub> emissions by 90% as compared to bare soil across the range
 of wind speeds tested.
 Wheat straw did not reduce total sediment loss for the range of speeds tested, but did reduce PM<sub>10</sub> emissions
 by 75% compared to a bare soil at wind speeds of up to 11 m s<sup>-1</sup>.

$category=

$Abstract=Dense, small-diameter stands generally require thinning from below to improve fire-tolerance.
 The resulting forest biomass can be used for energy production.
 The cost of harvesting, processing, and transporting small-diameter trees often exceeds revenues due to high costs
 associated with harvesting and transportation and low market values for forest biomass.
 Productivity and cost were evaluated in a whole-tree harvesting system on four fuel-reduction thinning treatment units in Arizona.
 Thinning required removal of trees less than 5.0 inches in diameter at breast height (DBH).
 Time studies were applied to evaluate the harvesting productivities and costs.
 Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the effects of different variables on costs.
 Simulations along with break-even analysis were used to examine the economic feasibility of using forest biomass for energy.
 Harvest productivity for each machine in the system ranged from 2.31 to 39.32 bone dry tons per productive machine hour (BDT/PMH).
 Harvest system costs including transportation for 36 miles or less averaged $55.27 per bone dry ton.
 Hauling cost represented the largest component (47.24%) of the total cost.
 Close to market operations, reduced off-highway hauling, shortened skidding distance, increased harvest tree size,
 and improvement in system balance could significantly reduce cost.
 Below the market value of $40 per bone dry ton for hog fuel, breaking even or realizing profit would remain difficult.
 Other values, such as reducing fire risks, preventing smoke pollutions, and creating renewable energy sources,
 should increase the attractiveness of harvesting forest biomass for energy.

$Abstract=What amount of extra energy can be generated after subtracting the total energy consumed to produce the
 biomass energy?
 Knowing the ratio between energy output and input is a valid question when highly mechanized systems that consume
 fossil fuels are used to harvest and transport forest biomass for energy.
 We estimated the net energy generated from mechanical fuel reduction thinning treatments on pure ponderosa pine stands in Arizona.
 The mechanized system (felling, skidding, loading, grinding, and hauling) was monitored for energy consumption.
 Potential energy output from harvested forest biomass was calculated based on hog fuel moisture content and heating value.
 A 9-day study showed positive net energy output of 3,471,376,292 BTUs.
 The net energy ratio between energy output and input was 10.41, and the energy cost from stump to energy plant was
 $4.65/million BTUs.
 Energy used for hauling hog fuel represented the largest part (36.27%) of the total energy input.
 The net energy ratio decreased 0.11 with each additional transportation mile.
 Energy cost increased by $0.04/million BTUs, $0.13/million BTUs, and $1.48/million BTUs for each additional
 mile of highway, unpaved road, and spur road, respectively.
 A one dollar per gallon diesel price increase added $0.34/million BTUs to the energy cost.
 Forest biomass energy has an encouraging net energy ratio compared with other biomass sources,
 but the high production cost and energy cost can impede the use of forest biomass for energy.

$Abstract=Quantifying critical conditions of rill formation can be useful for a better understanding of soil erosion processes.
 Current studies lack a consensus and related rationale on how to describe these conditions.
 This study was based on the concepts that
 (1) the shear stress available for erosion at any given point is a function of the runoff rate, the slope steepness,
 and hydraulic characteristics of the surface;
 (2) rill incision begins when overland flow shear stress exceeds soil critical shear stress; and
 (3) the distance from the top of the slope to the point where rills form can be measured and analyzed as length
 to rill initiation and decreases with increase in slope and rainfall intensity.
 These concepts were tested with a representative silty-clay soil from the Loess Plateau in northwestern China
 on a large sloping indoor plot (8 x 3 m), with five different slopes using simulated rainfall at three
 rainfall intensities.
 Values of several hydraulic parameters at rill initiation were determined from the experimental data.
 The results showed relationships among slope steepness, rainfall intensity, and location of rill initiation.
 It was found that slope was relatively more important than rainfall intensity in determining the location of
 rill initiation.
 Soil critical shear stress determined in this study ranged from 1.33 to 2.63 Pa, with an average of 1.94 Pa.
 Soil critical shear stress was inversely related to slope and was not influenced by rainfall intensity.
 The results of this study were comparable with those of previous investigators.

$Abstract=Mulching after wildfires is a common treatment designed to protect bare ground from
 raindrop impact and reduce subsequent erosion. We tested the effectiveness of three mulching
 methods on the Indian Fire near Prescott, Arizona, USA. The first method felled all fire-killed
 trees, chipped the logs and limbs, and spread the chips across the hillslope with a mobile selffeeding
 chipper. The second treatment spread compressed, tackified straw pellets that expand
 when wetted and release a soil flocculant. The third treatment was rice straw applied at 
 4.5&nbsp;Mg&nbsp;ha<sup>-1</sup> (2&nbsp;tons&nbsp;ac<sup>-1</sup>).
 Each treatment was applied to a small catchment with a silt fence
 sediment trap at the mouth. Sediment yield from an untreated (control) catchment was also
 measured. The treatments were tested by three erosion-causing summer rain events. The
 chipping treatment and the pellets reduced sediment yield by 80 to 100 percent compared to
 the control in the first two storms. In the third event, a multi-day storm followed by an intense
 thunderstorm, the pellets and straw reduced sediment yield 42 and 81 percent, respectively.
 The effectiveness of the chip treatment could not be completely assessed because of partial
 failure of the sediment fence. Vegetation cover was low on all sites; ground cover from pellets
 decreased more than did straw or chips by mid-October, probably accounting for the lower
 effectiveness in reducing erosion compared to straw.

$Abstract=Federal land management agencies have spent tens of millions of dollars on post-fire emergency watershed
 stabilization measures intended to minimize flood runoff, peakflows, onsite erosion, offsite sedimentation,
 and other hydrologic damage to natural habitats, roads, bridges, reservoirs, and irrigation systems

 The decision to apply post-fire treatments to reduce runoff and erosion is based on a risk analysis &ndash assessing
 the probability that damaging floods, erosion, and sedimentation will occur; the values that are at risk for damage;
 the need for reducing the risk of damage; and the magnitude of risk reduction that can reasonably be expected from
 mitigation treatments.

$Abstract=After the Valley Complex Fire burned 86 000 ha in western Montana in 2000,
 two studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log, straw wattle,
 and hand-dug contour trench erosion barriers in mitigating postfire runoff and erosion.
 Sixteen plots were located across a steep, severely burned slope, with a single barrier installed in 12 plots (four
 per treatment and four plots left untreated as controls.
 In a rainfall-plus-inflow simulation, 26 mm h<sup>-1</sup> rainfall was applied
 to each plot for 1 h and 48 L min <sup>-1</sup> of overland flow was added for the last 15 min.
 Total runoff from the contour-felled log
 (0.58 mm) and straw wattle (0.40 mm) plots was significantly less than from the control plots (2.0 mm), but the contour trench
 plots (1.3 mm) showed no difference.
 The total sediment yield from the straw wattle plots (0.12 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly
 less than the control plots (2.2Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>); the sediment yields in the contour-felled log plots
 (0.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 trench plots (2.5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 <br><br>
 After the simulations, sediment fences were installed to trap sediment eroded by natural rainfall. During the subsequent
 3 years, sediment yields from individual events increased significantly with increasing 10 min maximum intensity and rainfall
 amounts. High-intensity rainfall occurred early in the study and the erosion barriers were filled with sediment. There were no
 significant differences in event or annual sediment yields among treated and control plots. In 2001, the overall mean annual
 sediment yield was 21 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>; this value declined significantly to 0.6 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2002
 and 0.2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2003. The
 erosion barrier sediment storage used was less than the total available storage capacity; runoff and sediment were observed
 going over the top and around the ends of the barriers even when the barriers were less than half filled.

$Abstract=This study investigated the effect of cumulative overland flow on rill erodibility and
 critical shear stress on native surface roads in central Idaho. Rill erodibility decreased exponentially
 with increasing cumulative overland flow depth; however, critical shear stress did not change.
 The study demonstrated that road erodibility on the studied road changes over the course of one or more
 consecutive overland flow events. Therefore, model simulations that fail to take into consideration this
 change will probably over-estimate sediment yields. An exponential function describing the relationship
 between rill erodibility and cumulative overland flow depth is presented as a basis for future model
 development for simulating erosion on native surface roads.

$Abstract=An erosion control product made by shredding on-site woody materials was evaluated for mitigating erosion
 through a series of rainfall simulations.
 Tests were conducted on bare soil and soil with 30, 50, and 70% cover on a coarse and a fine-grained soil.
 Results indicated that the wood product known as wood shreds reduced runoff and soil loss from both soil types.
 Erosion mitigation ranged from 60 to nearly 100% depending on the soil type and amount of concentrated flow and
 wood shred cover.
 Wood shreds appear to be a viable alternative to agricultural straw. A wood shred cover of 50% appears optimal,
 but the appropriate coverage rate will depend on the amount of expected concentrated flow and soil type.

$Abstract=The concentrations of sediment and turbidity in stream water were monitored during culvert removals to determine the short term
effects of road obliteration. Sediment concentration was measured at 11 stream crossings among two locations in Idaho and one in
Washington. Sediment concentration immediately below the culvert outlet exceeded levels above the culvert outlet by at least three orders
of magnitude at all stream crossings. Sediment yields ranged from 170 to less than 1 kg in the 24-h period following culvert removal.
Turbidity exceeded the regulatory limits during culvert removal at all locations monitored in this study and remained above the limits
beyond the monitoring periods of 24 h at four of the locations. Sediment concentrations 100m downstream of the culvert outlet were
reduced by an order of magnitude, but did not change the turbidity values sufficiently to meet regulatory limits. Sediment concentrations
an average of 810m downstream of the culvert outlet were similar to sediment concentrations above the culvert for the entire excavation
period and turbidity regulations were met. Mitigation consisting of two straw bales placed in the stream caused a significant reduction in
sediment yield from an average of 67 kg to an average of 1.6 kg.

$Abstract=Between 1998 and 2002, six sites were established immediately after large wildfires in the western United
 States to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers in mitigating post-wildfire runoff and erosion.
 In each pair of matched, burned, and small watersheds (1.13 ha), one was treated with contour-felled log erosion barriers
 and one was left untreated as a control. For 4 to 6 post-fire years, runoff and sediment yields were measured and correlated
 with rain properties. High-intensity rainfall produced most of the measured runoff and sediment yields except in the
 southern California site, where long-duration rain events produced most of the runoff and erosion. For small rain events
 (less than the 2-year return period for the 10-min duration), the runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields were lower in
 the treated watersheds than in the control watersheds, but there was no treatment effect for rain events with larger return
 periods. Improper installation and degradation over time reduced the effectiveness of contour-felled log erosion barriers.
 Rainfall characteristics and installation procedures should be carefully considered before choosing contour-felled log
 erosion barriers for post-fire hillslope stabilisation.

$Abstract=Meaningful relationships between forest structure attributes measured in representative field plots on the ground and remotely sensed data
 measured comprehensively across the same forested landscape facilitate the production of maps of forest attributes such as basal area (BA) and
 tree density (TD). Because imputation methods can efficiently predict multiple response variables simultaneously, they may be usefully applied to
 map several structural attributes at the species-level. We compared several approaches for imputing the response variables BA and TD, aggregated
 at the plot-scale and species-level, from topographic and canopy structure predictor variables derived from discrete-return airborne LiDAR data.
 The predictor and response variables were associated using imputation techniques based on normalized and unnormalized Euclidean distance,
 Mahalanobis distance, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (aka Most Similar Neighbor, or MSN), Canonical
 Correspondence Analysis (aka Gradient Nearest Neighbor, or GNN), and Random Forest (RF). To compare and evaluate these approaches, we
 computed a scaled Root Mean Square Distance (RMSD) between observed and imputed plot-level BA and TD for 11 conifer species sampled in
 north-central Idaho. We found that RF produced the best results overall, especially after reducing the number of response variables to the most
 important species in each plot with regard to BA and TD. We concluded that RF was the most robust and flexible among the imputation methods
 we tested. We also concluded that canopy structure and topographic metrics derived from LiDAR surveys can be very useful for species-level
 imputation.

$Abstract=Millions of dollars are spent each year in the United States to mitigate the effects of wildfires and reduce the
 risk of flash floods and debris flows. Research from forested, chaparral, and rangeland communities indicate
 that severe wildfires can cause significant increases in soil water repellency resulting in increased runoff and
 erosion. Few data are available to document the effects of fire on the spatial and temporal variability in soil
 water repellency and potential impacts on infiltration and runoff on sagebrush-dominated landscapes. Soil
 water repellency, infiltration and runoff were assessed after two wildfires and one prescribed fire in three
 steep, sagebrush-dominated watersheds with coarse-textured soils. Water repellency was generally greater
 on unburned hillslopes and annual variability in water repellency had a greater impact on infiltration
 capacity than fire effects. The most significant impact of fire was canopy and ground cover removal on
 coppice microsites. Infiltration rates decreased on coppice microsites after fire even though soil water
 repellency was reduced. Fire-induced reduction in infiltration resulted from the combined effect of canopy
 and ground cover removal and the presence of naturally strong water repellent soils. Removal of ground
 cover likely increased the spatial connectivity of runoff areas from strongly water repellent soils. The results
 indicate that for coarse-textured sagebrush landscapes with high pre-fire soil water repellency, post-fire
 increases in runoff are more influenced by fire removal of ground and canopy cover than fire effects on soil
 water repellency and that the degree of these impacts may be significantly influenced by short-term
 fluctuations in water repellent soil conditions.

$Abstract=Post-fire runoff and erosion from wildlands has been well researched,
 but few studies have researched the degree of control
 exerted by fire on rangeland hydrology and erosion processes.
 Furthermore, the spatial continuity and temporal persistence
 of wildfire impacts on rangeland hydrology and erosion are not well understood.
 Small-plot rainfall and concentrated flow
 simulations were applied to unburned and severely burned hillslopes to determine the spatial continuity and persistence of
 fire-induced impacts on runoff and erosion by interrill and rill processes on steep sagebrush-dominated sites.
 Runoff and erosion were measured immediately following and each of 3 years post-wildfire.
 Spatial and temporal variability in post-fire hydrologic and erosional responses were compared with
 runoff and erosion measured under unburned conditions.
 Results from interrill simulations indicate fire-induced impacts were predominantly on coppice microsites
 and that fire influenced interrill sediment yield more than runoff.
 Interrill runoff was nearly unchanged by burning, but 3-year cumulative interrill sediment
 yield on burned hillslopes (50 g m<sup>-2</sup>) was twice that of unburned hillslopes
 (25 g m<sup>-2</sup>).
 The greatest impact of fire was on the dynamics of runoff once overland flow began.
 Reduced ground cover on burned hillslopes allowed overland flow to concentrate into rills.
 The 3-year cumulative runoff from concentrated flow simulations on burned hillslopes (298 l) was nearly 20 times
 that measured on unburned hillslopes (16 l).
 The 3-year cumulative sediment yield from concentrated flow on burned and
 unburned hillslopes was 20 400 g m<sup>-2</sup> and 6 g m<sup>-2</sup> respectively.
 Fire effects on runoff generation and sediment were greatly reduced, but remained, 3 years post-fire.
 The results indicate that the impacts of fire on runoff and erosion from severely
 burned steep sagebrush landscapes vary significantly by microsite and process,
 exhibiting seasonal fluctuation in degree, and
 that fire-induced increases in runoff and erosion may require more than 3 years to return to background levels.

$Abstract=A principal task of evaluating large wildfires is to assess fire's effect on the
 soil in order to predict the potential watershed response.
 Two types of soil water repellency tests, the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test and
 the mini-disk infiltrometer (MDI) test, were performed after the Hayman Fire in Colorado,
 in the summer of 2002 to assess the infiltration potential of the soil.
 Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery was also collected to map post-wildfire ground cover and soil condition.
 Detailed ground cover measurements were collected to validate the remotely sensed imagery and to examine the
 relationship between ground cover and soil water repellency.
 Percent ash cover measured on the ground was significantly correlated to WDPT (<i>r</i>=0.42; <i>p</i>-value&lt;0.0001),
 and the MDI test (<i>r</i>=-0.37; <i>p</i>-value&lt;0.0001).
 A Mixture Tuned Matched Filter (MTMF) spectral unmixing algorithm was applied to the hyperspectral imagery,
 which produced fractional cover maps of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation.
 The remotely sensed ash image had significant correlations to the water repellency tests,
 WDPT (<i>r</i>=0.24; <i>p</i>-value=0.001), and the MDI test (<i>r</i>=.0.21; <i>p</i>-value=0.005).
 An iterative threshold analysis was also applied to the ash and water repellency data to
 evaluate the relationship at increasingly higher levels of ash cover.
 Regression analysis between the means of grouped data: MDI time vs. ash cover data (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.75)
 and vs. Ash MTMF scores (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> =0.63) yielded significantly stronger relationships.
 From these results we found on-the-ground ash cover greater than 49% and remotely sensed ash cover greater than
 33% to be indicative of strongly water repellent soils.
 Combining these results with geostatistical analyses indicated a spatial autocorrelation range of 15 to 40&nbsp;m.
 Image pixels with high ash cover (&gt;33%), including pixels within 15 m of these pixel patches, were used to create a
 likelihood map of soil water repellency.
 This map is a good indicator of areas where soil experienced severe fire effects--areas that
 likely have strong water repellent soil conditions and higher potential for post-fire erosion.

$Abstract=This paper reports soil losses and observed sediment deposition for 16 randomly selected forest road sections
 in the National Forests of Alabama.
 Visible sediment deposition zones were tracked along the stormwater flow path to the most remote location as a means of
 quantifying soil loss from road sections.
 Volumes of sediment in deposition zones were determined by depth and deposition area measurements.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) was used to predict deposition in buffers and sediment
 leaving buffers from these forest road sections.
 WEPP estimates for these Coastal Plain sites were compared to measured sediment deposition from the forest road sections
 on the National Forests of Alabama.
 The applicability of WEPP to model these forest roads in the Coastal Plain of Alabama is evaluated with
 a model efficiency statistic using the observed field experiment data.
 The study found that of the 16 road segments analyzed, the average road segment length was 45 m,
 and the average quantity of sediment deposited onto the forest floor from road sections was 2300 kg.
 The WEPP: Road predictions were not significantly different from the observed sediment deposition.
 This research effort provides information to quantify the magnitude of soil erosion from typical Coastal Plain
 forest roads in the southern region of the U.S.
 The information reported is useful in soil erosion prediction models to validate predictions and create
 forest road management scenarios.

$Authors=Robichaud, Lewis, Ashmun
$category=
$Publisher=USFS RMRS
$Abstract=The Mini-disk Infiltrometer has been adapted for use as a field test of post-fire infiltration and soil water repellency.
 Although the Water Drop Penetration Time (WDPT) test is the common field test for soil water repellency, the Mini-disk
 Infiltrometer (MDI) test takes less time, is less subjective, and provides a relative infiltration rate. For each test, the porous base
 plate of the MDI is placed on the soil surface and the amount of water that passes into the soil in one minute is measured.
 <br><br>
 Thousands of paired WDPT and MDI tests were applied at burned sites throughout the western United States, and the data
 were significantly correlated (r = -0.64). A classification tree analysis was used to group the MDI test results into "degree
 of soil water repellency" categories (strong, weak, and none) that correspond to similar categories established for the WDPT
 test. Fire-induced soil water repellency has high spatial variability and requires a valid sampling method if the data are to be
 credible. The MDI test protocol and sampling method described in this Research Note were developed for post-fire assessment,
 and provide a practical evaluation of burned soil infiltration characteristics in a limited time.

$Abstract=Fire in sagebrush rangelands significantly alters canopy cover, ground cover, and soil properties which influence runoff and erosion processes.
Runoff can be generated more quickly and in larger volume following fire resulting in increased risk of severe erosion and downstream flooding.
The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model was developed to predict erosion on cropland, forest, and rangeland. WEPP is a tool that has
potential to model the effect of fire on hillslope hydrological processes and help managers address erosion and runoff risks following fire.
Experimental results on a steep (35 to 50% slope) sagebrush site suggest that rill erosion is the dominant erosion process following fire and the
WEPP parameterization equations related to the rill erosion process need improvements. Rill detachment estimates could be improved by
modifying regression-estimated values of rill erodibility. Also, the interactions of rill width and surface roughness on soil shear stress estimates
may also need to be modified. In this paper we report the effects of prescribed fire on runoff, soil erosion, and rill hydraulics and compare WEPP
estimated erosion for several modeling options with measured erosion.

 in forested areas.
 Applications of two wood-based products, wood strands and wood shreds, plus agricultural straw were investigated in
 this study.
 All three investigated mitigation treatments significantly reduced soil loss during both the snowmelt and
 summer seasons on coarse-grained soil.
 Mitigation treatments did not significantly reduce soil loss from the fine-grained soil,
 although the untreated plot produced two to six times as much sediment as the treated plots.
 A significant amount of mitigation material was lost from the shreds and straw plots over the course of the first year.
 Wood strands maintained their original cover over this time period.
 All mitigation treatments reduced plant revegetation on the fine-grained soil;
 however, wood strands did not inhibit revegetation on the coarse-grained soil.

$Abstract=Forest roads are obliterated to lower the risks of surface erosion and mass failures.
 One purpose of the road obliteration is to return the compacted forest roads to productive pre-road conditions,
 i.e., a forest floor with high infiltration capacity, low interrill erodibility, and high vegetation ground cover.
 It is important to know how these characteristics recover following road obliteration.
 Infiltration capacity, interrill erodibility, and vegetation ground cover are essential parameters for
 modeling erosion from obliterated roads for erosion prediction models such as the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP).
 We chose three sites located on the Payette National Forest, Idaho.
 Rainfall simulations were conducted on 1&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;1&nbsp;m plots with three replications in two consecutive years.
 Three 30 min storm events with an intensity of 89 mm h<sup>-1</sup> were applied to each plot.
 Photos were taken to determine vegetation ground cover.
 Infiltration capacity and interrill erodibility in this study were determined as 9.0 mm h<sup>-1</sup>
 for saturated hydraulic conductivity and 3.2&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup> kgï¿½s m<sup>-4</sup> for interrill erodibility.
 This study postulated a history of saturated hydraulic conductivity on a forest road from prior to road building
 to years after obliteration.
 The low elevation (1400&nbsp;m) site had vegetation ground cover of 27% after three years following road obliteration,
 while the other high elevation (1800&nbsp;m and 2200&nbsp;m) sites had 8% after four years.
 We conclude that four years was not sufficient time for obliterated roads to return to the pre-road (forest floor)
 conditions, especially for infiltration capacity.

$Abstract=After the Valley Complex Fire burned 86 000 ha in western Montana in 2000,
 two studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of contour-felled log, straw wattle,
 and hand-dug contour trench erosion barriers in mitigating postfire runoff and erosion.
 Sixteen plots were located across a steep, severely burned slope, with a single barrier installed in 12 plots (four
 per treatment and four plots left untreated as controls.
 In a rainfall-plus-inflow simulation, 26 mm h<sup>-1</sup> rainfall was applied
 to each plot for 1 h and 48 L min <sup>-1</sup> of overland flow was added for the last 15 min.
 Total runoff from the contour-felled log
 (0.58 mm) and straw wattle (0.40 mm) plots was significantly less than from the control plots (2.0 mm), but the contour trench
 plots (1.3 mm) showed no difference.
 The total sediment yield from the straw wattle plots (0.12 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) was significantly
 less than the control plots (2.2Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>); the sediment yields in the contour-felled log plots
 (0.58 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 trench plots (2.5 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>) were not significantly different.
 <br><br>
 After the simulations, sediment fences were installed to trap sediment eroded by natural rainfall. During the subsequent
 3 years, sediment yields from individual events increased significantly with increasing 10 min maximum intensity and rainfall
 amounts. High-intensity rainfall occurred early in the study and the erosion barriers were filled with sediment. There were no
 significant differences in event or annual sediment yields among treated and control plots. In 2001, the overall mean annual
 sediment yield was 21 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>; this value declined significantly to 0.6 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2002
 and 0.2 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> in 2003. The
 erosion barrier sediment storage used was less than the total available storage capacity; runoff and sediment were observed
 going over the top and around the ends of the barriers even when the barriers were less than half filled.

$Publisher=Wiley InterScience
$Abstract=Accelerated runoff and erosion commonly occur following forest fires due to combustion of protective forest floor material,
 which results in bare soil being exposed to overland flow and raindrop impact, as well as water repellent soil conditions.
 After the 2000 Valley Complex Fires in the Bitterroot National Forest of west-central Montana, four sets of six hillslope
 plots were established to measure first-year post-wildfire erosion rates on steep slopes (greater than 50%) that had burned
 with high severity. Silt fences were installed at the base of each plot to trap eroded sediment from a contributing area of
 100 m<sup>2</sup>.
 Rain gauges were installed to correlate rain event characteristics to the event sediment yield. After each sedimentproducing
 rain event, the collected sediment was removed from the silt fence and weighed on site, and a sub-sample taken to
 determine dry weight, particle size distribution, organic matter content, and nutrient content of the eroded material. Rainfall
 intensity was the only significant factor in determining post-fire erosion rates from individual storm events. Short duration, high
 intensity thunderstorms with a maximum 10-min rainfall intensity of 75 mm h<sup>-1</sup> caused the highest erosion rates (greater than
 20 t ha<sup>-1</sup>).
 Long duration, low intensity rains produced little erosion (less than 0.01 t ha<sup>-1</sup>).
 Total C and N in the collected
 sediment varied directly with the organic matter; because the collected sediment was mostly mineral soil, the C and N content
 was small. Minimal amounts of Mg, Ca, and K were detected in the eroded sediments. The mean annual erosion rate predicted
 by Disturbed WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) was 15% less than the mean annual erosion rate measured, which is
 within the accuracy range of the model.

Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Data Center produce Burned Area Reflectance
Classification (BARC) maps for use by Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) teams in rapid
response to wildfires. BAER teams desire maps indicative of fire effects on soils, but green and
nonphotosynthetic vegetation and other materials also affect the spectral properties of post-fire
imagery. Our objective was to assess how well satellite image-derived burn severity indices relate
to a suite of immediate post-fire effects measured on the ground. We measured or calculated fire
effects variables at 418 plots, nested in 50 field sites, located across the full range of burn severities
observed at the 2003 Black Mountain, Cooney Ridge, Robert, and Wedge Canyon wildfires in
western Montana, the 2003 Old and Simi wildfires in southern California, and the 2004 Porcupine
and Chicken wildfires in interior Alaska. We generated the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR),
differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative dNBR (RdNBR), Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI), and differenced NDVI (dNDVI) burn severity indices from Landsat&nbsp;5
Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery across these eight wildfires. The NBR correlated best with the fire
effects measures but insignificantly, meaning other indices could act as suitable substitutes. The
overstory (trees in Montana and Alaska, shrubs in California) measures appear to correlate best to
the image variables, followed by understory and surface cover measures. Exposed mineral soil and
soil water repellency were poorly correlated with the image variables, while green vegetation was
most highly correlated. The BARC maps are more indicative of post-fire vegetation condition than
soil condition. We conclude that the NBR and dNBR, from which BARC maps of large wildfires
in the United States are currently derived, are sound choices for rapid assessment of immediate
post-fire burn severity across the three ecosystems sampled. Our future research will focus on
spectral mixture analysis (SMA) because it acknowledges that pixel refl ectance is fundamentally a
mixture of charred, dead, green and nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil, rock and ash materials that
are highly variable at fine scales.

$Abstract=Vegetation response and burn severity were examined following eight large wildfires that burned
in 2003 and 2004: two wildfires in California chaparral, two each in dry and moist mixed-conifer
forests in Montana, and two in boreal forests in interior Alaska. Our research objectives were: 1) to
characterize one year post-fire vegetation recovery relative to initial fire effects on the soil surface
that could potentially serve as indicators of vegetation response (and thus, ultimately longerterm
post-fire ecosystem recovery), and 2) to use a remotely-sensed indicator of burn severity to
describe landscape patterns in fire effects. We correlated one-year post-fire plant species richness
and percent canopy cover to burn severity and to soil surface cover immediately after the fires.
For all eight wildfires, plant canopy cover and species richness were low and highly variable
one year post-fire. We found a greater number of forbs when compared to other plant life forms,
independent of burn severity. Plant cover was dominated by grasses in chaparral systems, by forbs
in mixed-conifer forests, and by shrubs in boreal forests, similar to the unburned vegetation. Finescale
variability in post-fire effects on soils, the diversity of pre-fire vegetation, and the resilience
of plants to fire likely explain the high variation observed in post-fire vegetation responses across
sites and burn severities. On most low and moderate burn severity sites, &gt;30% of the soil surface
was covered with organic material immediately post-fire, and one year later, the canopy cover of
understory vegetation averaged 10% or more, suggesting low risk to post-fire erosion. In California

burned with high severity, while in Alaska, 58% was mapped as high burn severity; we think
this is characteristic in Alaska, but uncharacteristic of chaparral fires, especially given the high
proportion of non-native species post-fi re in our chaparral sites. All fi res had a mosaic of different

$Abstract=Wildfi re effects on the ground surface are indicative of the potential for post-fire watershed erosion
response. Areas with remaining organic ground cover will likely experience less erosion than areas
of complete ground cover combustion or exposed mineral soil. The Simi and Old fires burned
~67,000 ha in southern California in 2003. Burn severity indices calculated from pre- and postfi
re multispectral imagery were differenced (i.e., differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR)) to
highlight fire-induced changes to soil and vegetation. Aerial and fi eld hyperspectral data were also
collected together with field ground cover measurements soon after the fires. Spectral endmembers
representing green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation (NPV), charred NPV, and charred
and uncharred inorganic materials (soil, ash, and rock) were used in a constrained linear spectral
unmixing process to determine the post-fire fractional ground cover of each component on the
ground surface. The spectral unmixing results, dNBR, and a Relative dNBR (RdNBR) were
validated using field-measured fractional ground cover estimates to determine which product best
predicted the conditions on the ground. The spectral unmixing results were significantly correlated
to all classes of charred and uncharred organics and inorganics, and the dNBR was the best indicator
of charred soil and green vegetation. The RdNBR had several significant correlations with the
ground data, yet did not consistently correlate well with any specifi c ground cover types. A map
of post-wildfire ground cover and condition, especially exposed soil and remaining vegetative
cover, is a good indicator of the fire's effect on the ground surface and the resulting potential for
hydrologic response.

$Abstract=Wildfire effects include loss of vegetative cover and changes to soil properties that
may lead to secondary effects of increased runoff, erosion, flooding, sedimentation,
and vulnerability to invasive weeds. These secondary effects may threaten
human life and safety, cultural and ecological resources, land use, and existing
infrastructure. Current Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) assessment
procedures require identification and valuation of values-at-risk (VAR) from the potential
secondary effects of wildfires. However, guidelines to estimate the monetary
value of these resources are limited and difficult to apply. This project examined
current methods for post-fire assessment of VAR and sought methodologies to
standardize and simplify the complex valuation task. A spreadsheet-based "VAR
Calculation Tool" supports this valuation framework. It is expected to improve defensibility
of VAR valuation and post-fire emergency treatment decisions.

$Abstract=Rapid Response Research is conducted during and immediately after wildland fires, in coordination with fire management teams, in order to collect information that can best be garnered in situ and in real-time.
 This information often includes fire behavior and fire effects data, which can be used to generate practical tools such as predictive fire models for managers.
 Drawing upon lessons learned from fire managers and researchers working on active wildland fires, we identify challenges including high costs, logistics, and safety; understanding and fitting into the fire management organization; building relationships with managers and other researchers; and science delivery.
 Our recommendations for safer and more effective Rapid Response Research are that researchers must understand the fire organizations and their objectives because a fire manager's primary responsibility is to manage the fire safely, not support research.
 In addition, researchers must be prepared with equipment, a "red card" signifying sufficient training and fitness, and appropriate knowledge when arriving to do research on a fire.
 Further, researchers must have and follow an operations plan.
 We recommend using a liaison to build strong relationships with managers and sharing what was learned.
 Science guided by questions that are important to managers is essential to improving both the understanding of wildland fire dynamics and developing strategies to address fire risk, rehabilitation, and restoration, yet researchers must be aware of the challenges of conducting research on active wildland fires.

$Abstract=After prescribed burns at three locations and one wildfire, rainfall simulations studies were completed
 to compare postfire runoff rates and sediment yields on ash-cap soil in conifer forest regions of northern
 Idaho and western Montana. The measured fire effects were differentiated by burn severity (unburned,
 low, moderate, and high).
 <br><br>
 Results indicate that this dry, undisturbed ash-cap soil exhibits high runoff rates and is naturally water
 repellent at the surface. However, the unburned, undisturbed ash-cap soil is not highly erodible due [to]
 the protective duff layer on the surface. When ash-cap soil was exposed to prolonged soil heating (high
 severity burn), surface water repellency was destroyed and a strong water repellent layer occurred a
 few centimeters beneath the soil surface. With the simulated rainfall, the non-water repellent surface
 layer became saturated; thus making the soil above the water repellent layer highly erodible&ndash;especially
 during high intensity rainfall.

$Abstract=Burn severity is mapped after wildfires to evaluate immediate and long-term fire effects on the landscape.
 Remotely sensed hyperspectral imagery has the potential to provide important information about fine-scale ground cover
 components that are indicative of burn severity after large wildland fires.
 Airborne hyperspectral imagery and ground data were collected after the 2002 Hayman Fire in Colorado to assess the
 application of high resolution imagery for burn severity mapping and to compare it to standard burn severity
 mapping methods.
 Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), a partial spectral unmixing algorithm, was used to identify the spectral
 abundance of ash, soil, and scorched and green vegetation in the burned area.
 The overall performance of the MTMF for predicting the ground cover components was satisfactory
 (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.21 to 0.48) based on a comparison to fractional ash, soil, and vegetation cover
 measured on ground validation plots.
 The relationship between Landsat-derived differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) values and the ground data
 was also evaluated (<i>r</i><sup>2</sup> = 0.20 to 0.58) and found to be comparable to the MTMF.
 However, the quantitative information provided by the fine-scale hyperspectral imagery makes it possible to more
 accurately assess the effects of the fire on the soil surface by identifying discrete ground cover characteristics.
 These surface effects, especially soil and ash cover and the lack of any remaining vegetative cover,
 directly relate to potential postfire watershed response processes.

$Abstract=The decision of where, when, and how to apply the most effective postfire erosion mitigation treatments requires land managers to assess the
risk of damaging runoff and erosion events occurring after a fire. To meet this challenge, the Erosion Risk Management Tool (ERMiT) was
developed. ERMiT is a web-based application that uses the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) technology to estimate erosion, in
probabilistic terms, on burned and recovering forest, range, and chaparral lands with and without the application of mitigation treatments. User
inputs are processed by ERMiT to combine rain event variability with spatial and temporal variabilities of hillslope burn severity and soil
properties, which are then used as WEPP input parameter values. Based on 20 to 40 individual WEPP runs, ERMiT produces a distribution of rain
event erosion rates with a probability of occurrence for each of five postfire years. In addition, rain event erosion rate distributions are generated
for postfire hillslopes that have been treated with seeding, straw mulch, and erosion barriers such as contour-felled logs or straw wattles.

   <b>Transactions in GIS</b> 10(3):395-415.
$Abstract=An empirical modeling of road related and non-road related landslide hazard for a large geographical area
 using logistic regression in tandem with signal detection theory is presented.
 This modeling was developed using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing data,
 and was implemented on the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho.
 The approach is based on explicit and quantitative environmental correlations between observed
 landslide occurrences, climate, parent material, and environmental attributes while the receiver operating
 characteristic (ROC) curves are used as a measure of performance of a predictive rule.
 The modeling results suggest that development of two independent models for road related and non-road related
 landslide hazard was necessary because spatial prediction and predictor variables were different for these models.
 The probabilistic models of landslide potential may be used as a decision support tool in forest planning
 involving the maintenance, obliteration or development of new forest roads in steep mountainous terrain.

$Abstract=This article describes a prototype modeling system for assessing forest management-related erosion at its source
and predicting sediment transport from hillslopes to stream channels and through channel networks to a watershed outlet.
We demonstrate that it is possible to develop a land management tool capable of accurately assessing the primary impacts
of spatiotemporally varied forest management practices on sediment yield and delivery at hillslope to watershed scales in
a single simulation. The modeling system consists of four components: (1) the TOpographic ParameteriZation (TOPAZ) model
for discretizing hillslope and channel elements, (2) the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model for evaluating
hillslope-scale surface erosion processes, (3) the National Center for Computational Hydrodynamics and Engineering.s
one-dimensional (CCHE1D) hydrodynamic-sediment transport model, and (4) an interface program to manage relational
databases and data transfer between modules. The coupled models were calibrated and validated with observed flow and
sediment load data from the North Fork Caspar Creek Experimental Watershed in coastal northern California. The coupled
models. predictions of peak flow rate and total flow volume were not significantly different from observed values. Predicted
sediment concentrations were significantly different from observed values, but within typical ranges for sediment transport
equations. We recommend that the WEPP model be improved to allow access to sub-daily time scale results so that it can be
better integrated with other watershed models.

$Abstract=Space and airborne sensors have been used to map area burned, assess characteristics of active fires, and
 characterize post-fire ecological effects. Confusion about fire intensity, fire severity, burn severity, and related terms
 can result in the potential misuse of the inferred information by land managers and remote sensing practitioners
 who require unambiguous remote sensing products for fire management. The objective of the present paper is to
 provide a comprehensive review of current and potential remote sensing methods used to assess fire behavior and
 effects and ecological responses to fire. We clarify the terminology to facilitate development and interpretation
 of comprehensible and defensible remote sensing products, present the potential and limitations of a variety of
 approaches for remotely measuring active fires and their post-fire ecological effects, and discuss challenges and
 future directions of fire-related remote sensing research.

$Abstract=Scientists are tasked with seeing their science applied, and, in turn, managers rely on the objectiveness of scientists
to make defensible decisions. Scientists and managers currently use remote sensing to map, understand, and predict
the ecological effects of fire. Although much has been learned, challenges remain; and there is an urgent need to
provide science and tools that managers can use to address challenging fire management issues. In order to provide
such data and products, scientists must understand the needs and expectations of fire managers. To facilitate
bridging this gap between science and application, we brought together an expert panel of both researchers and
managers to discuss information needs and challenges and to make recommendations for the mapping of active fire
characteristics and post-fire effects. This paper provides a summary of this panel discussion, which highlighted
challenges relating to terminology, interpretation, data availability, etc; and suggested recommendations for
partnerships and strategies to address these challenges.

$Abstract=The effects of a wildfire on the ground surface are indicative of the potential for post-fire watershed response.
 Areas with remaining organic ground cover (green, uncharred, or charred) will likely experience less erosion than areas of
 complete ground cover combustion (ash) or exposed mineral soil, and may not need post-fire rehabilitation
 treatments. We collected aerial and field hyperspectral data together with field ground cover measurements after the
 2003 Simi Fire in southern California in order to create a map of the remaining ground surface components. Spectral
 endmembers representing green vegetation, charred vegetation, charred soil, and uncharred soil were used in a
 constrained linear spectral unmixing process to determine the post-fire fractional ground cover of each surface
 component. Significant correlations (<i>r</i> &gt; 0.2, <i>p</i>-value &lt; 0.0001) were found between the fractional cover interpreted
 from hyperspectral images and corresponding field measurements indicating that these methods are appropriate for
 mapping post-fire ground conditions.

$Abstract=The recent modification of WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) has improved the
original model.s applicability to hydrology and erosion modeling in forest watersheds. To generate
reliable topographic and hydrologic inputs for the WEPP model, carefully selecting Digital Elevation
Models (DEMs) with appropriate resolution and accuracy is essential because topography is a major
factor controlling water erosion. LIght Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), a new remote sensing
technology, provides an alternative for generating fine and high-quality DEMs. This study applies
WEPP (v2006.201) for hydrological and erosion simulation under forest conditions and evaluates the
effects of DEM resolution and accuracy on watershed hydrology and water erosion prediction at a
watershed scale. Stream flow and total suspended solids (TSS) in two small forest watersheds
located in northern Idaho were collected and processed. A total of six DEMs from three sources
(NED, SRTM, and LIDAR) at three resolutions (30 m, 10 m, and 4 m) were obtained and used to
calculate topographic parameters as inputs to the WEPP model. WEPP-simulated hydrologic and
erosion results using the six DEMs were compared with the field-observed data. For both study
watersheds, DEMs with different resolutions and sources generated varied topographic and
hydrologic attributes, which in turn led to significantly different erosion predictions by WEPP.

$Abstract=Adequate and reliable erosion prediction tools are needed for sound forest resources management.
 Numerous watershed models have been developed during the past.
 These models, however, are often limited in their applications largely due to their inappropriate representations
 of the hydrological processes involved.
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has demonstrated its usefulness in certain forest applications,
 such as modeling erosion from a segment of in-sloped or out-sloped road, and harvested or burned units.
 Nevertheless, when used for modeling water flow and sediment discharge from a forest watershed of
 complex topography and channel systems, WEPP consistently underestimates these quantities, in particular,
 the water flow at the watershed outlet.
 <br><br>
 The goal of this study was to improve the WEPP model such that it can be applied to adequately simulate
 forest watershed hydrology and erosion.
 Specific objectives were to:
  (1) identify and correct WEPP algorithms that inappropriately represent forest hydrologic processes; and
  (2) verify the modified model.
 Substantial changes were made in the approach to, and algorithms for modeling percolation of soil water and
 subsurface lateral flow in WEPP.
 The modified codes were subsequently applied to Hermada watershed,
 a small watershed located in the Boise National Forest in northern Idaho.
 The modeling results were compared with those obtained by using the original WEPP and the field-observed
 runoff and erosion data.
 Conclusions of this study include:
  (1) compared to the original model, the modified WEPP more realistically and properly represents the hydrologic processes
      in a forest setting; and
  (2) application of the modified model produced satisfactory results,
      demonstrating the adequacy of the model modifications.

$Abstract=Wind erosion is a widespread problem in much of the western United States due to arid
 conditions and persistent winds. Fugitive dust from eroding land poses a risk to both environmental
 quality and human health. Since the advent of the Clean Air Act in 1971, ambient air quality
 standards have been set regulating particulate matter in the atmosphere. Agricultural straw has
 been widely used for erosion control, but there are numerous drawbacks to its use. In addition to the
 fact that it is a lightweight material and lacks stability during high wind events, there is growing
 concern over the introduction of noxious weeds to wildlands, chemical residues from pesticides, and
 risks associated with dust particles liberated from the shattering of straw elements during the
 application process. The efficacy of a wood strand material, a wood analog to straw, for wind
 erosion mitigation was investigated during this study. A series of wind tunnel tests were conducted
 to evaluate material properties of wood strands in terms of reducing total sediment loss and
 maintaining air quality. Results indicate that wood strands are stable at wind speeds of up to 18 m/s,
 while wheat straw is only stable at wind speeds of up to 6.5 m/s. At a wind velocity of 18 m/s, the
 straw, due to its instability, did not reduce soil loss; however, wood strands reduced total sediment
 loss and peak dust emissions by over 90% when compared to a bare soil.

$Abstract=Erosion in the first year after a wildfire can be up to three orders of magnitude greater than
the erosion from undisturbed forests. To mitigate potential postfire erosion, various erosion control
treatments are applied on highly erodible areas with downstream resources in need of protection.
Because postfire erosion rates generally decline by an order of magnitude for each year of recovery,
effective erosion mitigation treatments are most needed during the first year or two after a fire.
Postfire treatments include broadcast seeding, scarification and trenching, physical erosion barriers
such as contour-felled logs and straw wattles, and mulching with wheat straw, wood straw, and
hydromulch. This paper summarizes data from more than seven years of studies to evaluate the
effectiveness of postfire erosion mitigation treatments at the hillslope and small watershed-scale in
the western U.S. Results suggest that some mitigation treatments may help reduce erosion for
some, but not all, rainfall events. Generally, mulching is more effective than seeding, scarifying, or
erosion barriers. For small rainfall events, reduction in first year erosion rates have been measured
for engineered wood straw and straw mulch (60 to 80%), contour-felled log erosion barriers (50 to
70%), and hydromulch (19%). Grass seeding treatments have little effect on first year erosion
reduction. For intense rain events (I10 greater than 40 mm h<sup>-1</sup>) there was little difference between
treated and non-treated areas.

$Abstract=Erosion following wildfire can be as much as 1000 times the erosion from an undisturbed forest.
  In August, 2005, the largest fire in the lower 48 states occurred in the Umatilla National Forest in Southeast Washington.
  Researchers from the Rocky Mountain Research Station assisted the forest in estimating soil erosion using three different
  applications of the WEPP model.
  GeoWEPP was used to determine the onsite distribution of soil erosion.
  WEPP Windows Watershed Version was used to estimate peak runoff rates of each of the ten small watersheds analyzed.
  The ERMiT interface to WEPP was used to estimate the probability of erosion amounts on selected hillslopes,
  and the benefits of mulching those slopes.
  Within the three days available for analysis, about 38 percent of the burned area was analyzed.
  This paper summarizes the analytical methods, and the findings of the prediction runs.

$Abstract=Sediment budget analyses require watershed scale evaluation of road erosion and delivery.
 The Watershed Erosion Prediction (WEPP) model, as developed by the USDA Forest Service,
 simulates sediment detachment and delivery for a road, fill, and buffer system.
 Time and budget constraints typically prevent a comprehensive sediment loading analysis using WEPP throughout a watershed.
 We present an automated approach to run the hillslope version of WEPP to simulate sediment detachment and delivery
 for a large road network.
 Road attributes are acquired from global positioning system-assisted road surveys and mapped in a geographic information
 system (GIS).
 After data manipulation in GIS and Excel, the required input files for WEPP are built.
 The approach can be applied to multiple road designs and climate regimes, with unique attributes for each road segment.
 We applied the automated approach to the 3,040 km<sup>2</sup> South Fork Clearwater River watershed for
 1,017 km of road divided into 6,955 road segments.
 The availability of analysis capabilities of the WEPP results from large road networks within GIS provides a
 spatially explicit tool for the management and evaluation of sediment production throughout large road networks.

$Abstract=The US Forest Service has identified unmanaged all terrain vehicle (ATV) use as a threat
to forested lands and grasslands. Some undesirable impacts include severely eroded soils, user-created
unplanned roads, disrupted wetland ecosystems, as well as general habitat destruction and
degraded water quality throughout forested lands. A study was conducted by the Rocky Mountain
Research Station and the San Dimas Technology Development Center to evaluate ATV impacts.
Trails were classified into one of three disturbances classes of low, medium, and high, based on loss
of litter and vegetation, trail width, and depth of wheel ruts. Following trail condition assessment,
rainfall simulations were conducted to measure erosion parameters on each of the three disturbance
classes. While infiltration parameters decreased with increased levels of ATV traffic, there was no
statistically significant difference among the three classification levels. There was, however,
generally a significant difference between undisturbed and the combined disturbed conditions.
Similar significant differences existed for interrill erosion. In all cases sediment loss would be
expected to increase due to ATV traffic. Information acquired from this study will be used to estimate
ATV traffic induced erosion and assist in the managing of ATV use.

$abstract=Two blends of manufactured wood strands with different lengths were tested for
effectiveness in controlling erosion. Wood strand blends were tested on two soils, two slopes,
and at three coverage amounts. Laboratory rainfall simulations were conducted to evaluate
runoff and sediment loss. Wood strands were effective in delaying runoff, reducing runoff
volume, and reducing sediment loss. There was no statistically significant difference between
the two wood strand blends with respect to runoff or sediment loss. In comparison to bare soil
with no cover, sediment loss was reduced by at least 70 percent for all cover amounts tested and
among each soil type, slope and flow event. In comparison to estimates of sediment loss
reductions due to agricultural straw (Burroughs and King, 1989), wood strand materials were
equally effective on coarse grained soils and superior to straw on fine grained soils. In contrast
to agricultural straw, manufactured wood strands are inherently weed and pesticide free.
Consequently, wood-based materials may be a more appropriate material for erosion mitigation,
especially in areas where introduction of non-native species is of great concern.

$Abstract=An important element of evaluating a large wildfire is to assess its effects on the soil in order to predict
 the potential watershed response.
 After the 55 000 ha Hayman Fire on the Colorado Front Range,
 24 soil and vegetation variables were measured to determine the key variables that could be used for a
 rapid field assessment of burn severity.
 The percentage of exposed mineral soil and litter cover proved to be the best predictors of burn severity in this environment.
 Two burn severity classifications, one from a statistical classification tree and the other a
 Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) burn severity map, were compared with measured ground truth burn severity at
 183 plots and were 56% and 69% accurate, respectively.
 <br><br>
 This study also compared water repellency measurements made with the water drop penetration time (WDPT) test
 and a mini-disk infiltrometer (MDI) test.
 At the soil surface, the moderate and highly burned sites had the strongest water repellency,
 yet were not significantly different from each other.
 Areas burned at moderate severity had 1.5 times more plots that were strongly water repellent at the surface than
 the areas burned at high severity.
 However, the high severity plots most likely had a deeper water repellent layer that was not detected
 with our surface tests.
 The WDPT and MDI values had an overall correlation of <i>r</i> = -0.64(<i>p</i> < 0.0001)
 and appeared to be compatible methods for assessing soil water repellency in the field.
 Both tests represent point measurements of a soil characteristic that has large spatial variability;
 hence, results from both tests reflect that variability, accounting for much of the remaining variance.

$Abstract=Measuring and modeling erosion after disturbances, such as prescribed fire and wild-fire,
has been a major research focus for the past 15 years. Fire-induced changes in-clude
increased erosion due to loss of the protective forest floor layer, loss of soil
water storage, and in some cases, creation of water repellent soil conditions. These
conditions increase the potential for flooding, debris flows, and sedimentation, which
are of special concern to people who live and mange resources in the areas adjacent to
burned areas. A web-based erosion risk management tool, ERMiT, has been developed
to predict erosion from postfire hillslopes and to evaluate the potential effectiveness
of various erosion mitigation practices. The model uses a probabilistic approach that
incorporates variability in climate, soil properties, and burn severity for forests, range-land,
and chaparral hillslopes. The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) engine
is used in a Monte Carlo simulation mode to provide erosion rate probabilities. The
one-page custom interface is targeted to hydrologists and soil scientists and allows
the user to select climate, soil texture, burn severity, and hillslope topography.
For a given hillslope, the model uses a single 100-year run to obtain climate variability and
twenty 4 to 8 year runs to incorporate soil property and spatial burn severity variability.
The output, in both tabular and graphical form, relates the probability of soil erosion
exceeding a given amount in each of the first four years following the fire. Event
statistics are provided to show the magnitude and rainfall intensity of the storms used
to predict erosion rates. ERMiT also allows users to compare the effects of various
mitigation treatments (mulches, seeding, and barrier treatments such as contour-felled
logs or straw wattles) on erosion. Data to populate ERMiT was obtained using rainfall
simulation and concentrated flow (rill) techniques to obtain infiltration and erodibility
parameters for a variety of burn severities, soil textures and rehabilitation treatments
(straw mulch, hydromulch, contour-felled logs, straw wattles). Model validation ef-forts
are ongoing at nine paired watershed sites around the western United States.

$Publisher=CSIRO/International Journal of Wildland Fire
$Abstract=The increasing size and severity of wildfires in the western United States has caused a corresponding increase in
 post-fire emergency erosion control activities.
 Hillslope treatments, such as broadcast seeding, mulching and installed barriers, are applied to reduce runoff and erosion,
 as well as downslope sedimentation. However, there are few data to determine if these post-fire treatments are practical
 and effective.
 Direct measurement of hillslope erosion, particularly in the remote settings where wildfires occur,
 is time consuming and costly.
 Rainfall simulation, sediment fences and paired catchment studies have been adapted for measuring post-fire erosion
 in the mountainous forest regions of the western USA.
 The use of paired catchments to measure hillslope erosion and evaluate treatment effectiveness is illustrated by
 an ongoing experiment of six contour-felled log erosion barrier research sites.
 Deciding which type of treatments to use, as well as the locations and timing of application,
 requires treatment cost and effectiveness to be weighed against potential damage from unmitigated erosion.
 To assist in this process, a web-based Erosion Risk Management Tool has been developed that incorporates
 variability in rainfall, burn severity and soil properties, as well as treatment options to provide probabilistic erosion
 estimates for 4 years after a fire.

$Title=Evaluation of runoff prediction from WEPP-based erosion models for harvested and burned forest watersheds
$Year=2005
$Authors=Covert, Robichaud, Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASAE
$Abstract=This study evaluates runoff predictions generated by GeoWEPP (Geo-spatial interface to the Water Erosion
 Prediction Project) and a modified version of WEPP v98.4 for forest soils. Three small (2 to 9 ha) watersheds in the mountains
 of the interior Northwest were monitored for several years following timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed climate
 variables, percent ground cover, soil erodibility values, and GIS-derived slope data were used to drive the models. Predictions
 of total yearly runoff generated by GeoWEPP (WEPP v2002.7) and the modified WEPP model were compared to total yearly
 runoff measured at each watershed. In addition, measured seasonal values were compared to the predictions generated by
 the modified WEPP model. GeoWEPP significantly underpredicted the total yearly runoff for all three sites. The modified
 WEPP model, with algorithm changes to account for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow, predicted total yearly
 runoff for two of the three sites with an index of agreement (d) of 0.8 and 0.9 for each. The third site performed less accurately,
 with d = 0.3. In the seasonal runoff predictions, the modified WEPP model was most accurate for the spring months (higher
 runoff) but was a poor predictor for other seasons when the measured runoff rates were low. The GeoWEPP model successfully
 incorporates digital elevation data, but the WEPP version used to process the data does not adequately represent the
 hydrological processes of forests. The lateral flow modifications that were added to the WEPP model improved predictions
 of runoff in forests, thus suggesting that further refinement of these calculations may improve the accuracy of WEPP-based
 models when applied to forest environments.

 conducting a long-term study of road obliteration that includes measurements of
 sediment generated during obliteration activities. Three culvert locations in the Horse
 Creek drainage of Idaho were monitored during road obliteration activity. Sediment
 yields varied from 2 to 170 kg. Yields decreased rapidly downstream and at the
 mouth of each watershed sediment concentrations did not exceed 150 mg/L except
 during a precipitation event. Turbidity values exceeded the Idaho Department of
 Environmental Quality limit of 50 NTU above background immediately below the
 culvert, but not at the watershed mouth.

 trails is needed in order to make management decisions concerning ATV use on National Forest
 lands. Factors which may determine impacts of ATVs include site characteristics, such as soil
 moisture, soil types, existing terrain, and storm events, and ATV attributes such as vehicle type,
 tire tread, amount of trail use, and rider attitude.

$Title=Postfire rehabilitation treatments: are we learning what works?
$Year=2005
$Authors=Robichaud, Brown
$category=
$Publisher=ASCE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Major concerns after wildfires are the increased erosion and flooding potential
 due to loss of the protective forest floor layer, loss of water storage, and the creation
 of water repellent soil conditions. Treatments to mitigate postfire erosion and runoff
 are commonly applied on highly erodible areas; however the effectiveness of these
 treatments has had limited scientific evaluation. In recent years postfire hillslope
 treatment effectiveness has been evaluated by using sediment fences and small
 catchments to directly measure sediment yields from burned hillslopes and relate
 those results to the specific rain events that caused them. In addition, the erosion from
 areas treated with various rehabilitation treatments (seeding, mulching, erosion
 barriers, etc.) is compared to non-treated areas. Although many of these studies are
 still in progress, preliminary results suggest that some mitigation treatments may help
 reduce erosion for some, but not all, rain events. Immediately after installation,
 contour-felled log erosion barriers can reduce erosion up to 70% for small rain
 events. For high intensity rain events (10-min max intensity of 40 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> or greater)
 there little difference in erosion reduction between treated and non-treated areas.
 Other studies suggest that the natural mulch provided by dead conifer needles in areas
 of low and moderate burn severity can reduce rill erosion by 30 to 40% and interrill
 erosion by 50 to 70%.

$Title=Predicting cumulative watershed effects of fuel management with improved WEPP technology
$Year=2005
$Authors=Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASCE
$Abstract=The increase in severe wildfires in recent years is due in part to an abundance
 of fuels in forests. In an effort to protect values at risk, and decrease the severity of
 wildfires, forest managers have embarked on a major program of fuel reduction. Past 
 research has shown that such fuel reduction may have minimal impact at a hillslope
 scale, but when numerous hillsides are disturbed within a watershed over a number of
 years, the cumulative effect of such disturbances may be unacceptable. In addition,
 road networks are necessary to support fuel management activities by providing
 access for thinning crews, small diameter timber extraction, and fire crews. These
 road networks were frequently designed and constructed to minimize cost, and do not
 necessarily minimize adverse watershed impacts. Research findings from wildfire,
 fuel management, and roads will be presented to provide a context for predictive
 modeling. There are some new predictive tools to aid in watershed analysis. These
 include the GeoWEPP GIS wizard, the online WEPP:Road Batch processor and
 WEPP FuMe fuel management analysis tools, and a revised WEPP hillslope model
 with improved water balance and lateral flow capabilities. In this paper, we use these
 new technologies to explore the sources of sediment and runoff within a typical
 forested watershed. The paper shows improvements in runoff prediction with the
 revised WEPP model, as well as the relative importance of roads, wildfire, prescribed
 fire, and thinning operations in generating sediment at the hillslope and watershed
 scales. The analysis of the performance of the modified WEPP interface showed that
 there are problems within the WEPP Watershed stream flow routing routines that will
 need to be addressed before use of this modified model can be recommended.

  Two blends of wood strands were statistically equal to straw in
  reducing both runoff and sediment production.
  Both the straw and each of the wood fiber mixes reduced erosion by 98 percent
  as compared to the bare soil.
  This result implies that wood fibers are an acceptable alternative to
  agricultural straw in erosion control applications.
  Further work is underway to determine optimum width and length mixes,
  application rates, and decomposition rates for the wood fibers.

 Remote Sensing Applications Center Project Report RSAC-0068-RPT1.
 Salt Lake City, UT: US Department of Agriculture Forest Service, Remote Sensing Application Center. 29&nbsp;p.
$Abstract=The objectives of this project were to assess the potential of hyperspectral data to determine
 burn severity after wildfires and evaluate if the high spectral information makes it possible to
 detect water-repellency conditions of the soil. A burn-severity map helps prioritize
 rehabilitation efforts after a fire, reducing subsequent soil erosion and other problems.
 Generating such a classification requires developing a methodology to analyze the data and
 compiling a library containing spectra of burn-related materials.
 <br><br>
 Existing burn-severity classifications based on multispectral broadband remote sensing data 
 have a few drawbacks that using higher spectral and spatial data can help solve. To analyze
 this more detailed information, two types of field data were collected in selected locations:
 plot data related to water repellency and burn severity, as well as field spectrometer data
 about surface materials that could be related to the image spectra.
 <br><br>
 The imagery data were analyzed using two methods. One method selects two bands of the
 short-wave infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum to generate a simple ratio. This
 method is analogous to the normalized burn ratio that currently classifies broadband
 multispectral data but makes use of the additional narrow bands available in hyperspectral
 imagery, making it easier to target the wavelength used in the analysis. The second method,
 based on the mixture-tuned, matched-filtering algorithm, is a more traditional hyperspectral
 technique. The spectra comprising the signal present in a pixel are unmixed based on .pure.
 end-member spectra generated from material present on the surface.
 <br><br>
 The ratio method has the advantage of delivering results fairly fast compared to the second
 method because there is less need to preprocess the data accurately. However, just as the
 multispectral ratio does, this method produces a result for every pixel in the image whether it
 is related to the burn or not. The unmixing method results in less false positives and relates
 the classification of the data to materials present on the ground. Unmixing the data is,
 however, time consuming and very sensitive to preprocessing procedures such as
 atmospheric correction.
 <br><br>
 Relating the spectra to soil water-repellency conditions needs additional research. The
 orthorectification of the imagery was too coarse for accurate correlation with field data. But
 even with better rectification, this problem may be hard to solve. Determining water-repellency
 conditions often requires access to the soil just below the surface. Since visible
 and near-infrared wavelengths cannot penetrate the soil particles, remote sensing may not be
 the right tool. In locations where the fire has not burned the canopy, soil conditions cannot
 be assessed at all.

$Abstract=Forest fires may induce changes in soil organic properties that often lead to water repellent conditions within the soil
 profile that decrease soil infiltration capacity. The remote detection of water repellent soils after forest fires would
 lead to quicker and more accurate assessment of erosion potential. An airborne hyperspectral image was acquired
 over the Hayman Fire in the summer of 2002. A supervised classification was performed in an attempt to identify
 soils that were highly water repellent. The classification was not accurate in determining water repellency severity,
 but it was nearly 80 percent accurate for identifying the presence of surface water repellency. According to the
 classified image, nearly 20 percent of the Hayman Fire had water repellent soils.

$Abstract=The USFS Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) and the USGS EROS Data Center (EDC) produce Burned
 Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) maps for use by Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) teams in
 rapid response to wildfires. BAER teams desire maps indicative of soil burn severity, but photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic
 vegetation also influences the spectral properties of post-fire imagery. Our objective was to assess
 burn severity both remotely and on the ground at six 2003 wildfires. We analyzed fire-effects data from 34 field
 sites located across the full range of burn severities observed at the Black Mountain Two, Cooney Ridge, Robert,
 and Wedge Canyon wildfires in western Montana and the Old and Simi wildfires in southern California. We
 generated Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), delta Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), and Normalized Difference
 Vegetation Index (NDVI) indices from Landsat 5, SPOT 4, ASTER, MASTER and MODIS imagery. Pearson
 correlations between the 44 image and 79 field variables having an absolute value greater than 0.5 were judged
 meaningful and tabulated in overstory, understory, surface cover, and soil infiltration categories. Vegetation
 variables produced a higher proportion of meaningful correlations than did surface cover variables, and soil
 infiltration variables the lowest proportion of meaningful correlations. Soil properties had little measurable
 influence on NBR, dNBR or NDVI, particularly in low and moderate severity burn areas where unconsumed
 vegetation occludes background reflectance. BAER teams should consider BARC products much more indicative of
 post-fire vegetation condition than soil condition. Image acquisition date, in relation to time of field data collection
 and time since fire, appears to be more important than type of imagery or index used. We recommend preserving
 the raw NBR or dNBR values in an archived map product to enable remote monitoring of post-fire vegetation
 recovery. We further recommend that BAER teams rely on the continuous BARC-Adjustable (BARC-A) product
 (and assign their own severity thresholds as needed) more than the classified BARC product, which oversimplifies
 highly heterogeneous burn severity characteristics on the ground.

$Abstract=This study assesses the accuracy of GeoWEPP model (Geospatial Water Erosion
 Prediction Project) and a modified version of WEPP for forest soils. Three small
 watersheds (2-9 ha) in the Interior Northwest were monitored for several years following
 timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed site factors of climate variables, percent
 ground cover and soil erodibility values, along with digital slope data were used to drive
 the models. The GeoWEPP and WEPP model predictions of runoff and sediment yield
 were compared to observed yearly totals from each watershed. Monthly totals were also
 compared the results of the modified version of WEPP. The yearly results showed that
 GeoWEPP under-predicts runoff and sediment and the results were not acceptable at a 90
 percent confidence interval. The same data was tested with the modified version of
 WEPP containing modified algorithms for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow
 intended to better represent forest hydrology. This modified version of the WEPP model
 showed improvements to yearly predictions of runoff and sediment over the GeoWEPP
 model and generated acceptable results of runoff and sediment. Monthly values of runoff
 and sediment yield generated by the modified WEPP generated acceptable results
 compared to the observed monthly values. The GeoWEPP model has the potential to
 model erosion with the incorporation of digital elevation data, but lacks the ability to
 accurately represent forest hydrology. The incorporation of a WEPP algorithm that
 represent forest soils more realistically would improve the results of GeoWEPP
 predictions.

$Abstract=The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) is a physically based erosion model
 for applications to dryland and irrigated agriculture, rangeland, and forests.
 U.S. Forest Service (USFS) experience showed that WEPP was not being adopted because
 of the difficulty in building files describing the input conditions in the existing interfaces.
 To address this difficulty, a suite of Internet interfaces with a database was developed to
 more easily predict soil erosion for a wide range of climatic and forest conditions,
 including roads, fires, and timber harvest.
 The database included a much larger climate database than was previously available
 for applications in remote forest and rangeland areas.
 Validation results showed reasonable agreement between erosion values reported in the
 literature and values predicted by the interfaces to the WEPP model.

$category=fire effects, duff moisture meter
$Publisher=ASAE
$Abstract=The tough, lightweight DMM600 is a portable,
  battery-powered sensor that provides real-time water
  content measurements of non-homogenous material.
  This sensor was originally developed to measure forest
  floor duff (decomposing organic material) moisture content
  and thus, aid in the timing of prescribed fires.
  <br><br>
  However, the DMM600 has been found to be useful
  with other organic materials such as compost,
  silage, wood waste, and saw dust.
  It also has been used successfully to measure
  the water content of mineral soil during
  road construction.
  <br><br>
  Given the rough field environment inherent
  to forest fire, the duff moisture meter is
  designed to provide accurate results in the
  field with a minimum amount of sample
  preparation and measurement logistics.

$Abstract=Increased runoff and erosion commonly occur after wildfires with the onset of precipitation events. Various
 erosion mitigation treatments are often used after wildfires to reduce flooding and sedimentation. The
 effectiveness of these treatments has not been well documented in the literature; therefore we undertook a
 rapid response approach (within four weeks following fire suppression) to install small catchment monitoring
 systems to compare treatment effectiveness. A paired watershed approach uses two adjacent and similar
 catchments (5-20 ac) after wildfires, treating one catchment and using the other catchment as a control.
 We developed a rapid response monitoring system that can be installed in a few weeks to monitor sediment
 yield and runoff response. These systems are usually left in place for three to five years.
 <br><br>
 Each installation has a complete weather station and electronic measuring devices to record streamflow and
 sediment accumulation in a storage basin. Thesediment basins are cleaned out manually after each
 storm event in order to relate the event (intensity, amount and duration) to runoff and sediment yield.
 The data is automatically transmitted each day via cell phone or radio transmission to our computer server,
 thus making the data available daily on our web page. We have installed six paired catchments to date in
 Colorado, Washington, two in California, and two in Montana. Preliminary results suggest that 1) first year
 storm events produce the largest runoff and sediment response and 2) treatment effectiveness is less with
 high intensity short duration storm events. This rapid response protocol allows for quick installation of a
 monitoring system to provide an assessment of treatment effectiveness.

$Title=Modification of the evapotranspiration routines in the WEPP model: part 1.
$Year=2003
$Authors=Elliot
$category=
$Publisher=ASAE
$Abstract=The physical processes of evaporation and transpiration, collectively termed
 evapotranspiration, are discussed with respect to the unique conditions specific to forested
 environments. Forests have significant variations in ET rates due to 1) diurnal, seasonal, and annual
 climatic fluctuations; 2) spatiotemporal differences in vegetation; 3) evaporation of precipitation
 intercepted by vegetation, litter, and soil; 4) evaporation from water bodies; and 5) physiographic
 differences. The earliest methods for computing ET relied on empirical relations between climatic
 variables and consumptive water use by crops. Later formulations derived potential evaporation by
 relating solar radiation and temperature to the physical process of latent and sensible heat flux. To
 generalize Penman.s equation for crops that were water-stressed, Monteith incorporated a canopy
 resistance term to describe the effect that partially closed stomates have on evapotranspiration.
 Later researchers have modified these equations to account for variable crop density, rainfall
 interception, bare-soil evaporation, and multiple canopy layers. WEPP primarily uses a modification
 of Ritchie's method to compute ET. Although WEPP gives the user the option to use either
 Penman's, Priestly-Taylor's, Hargraves', or Penman-Monteith's equations for calculating ET, the
 coding for Hargraves' and Penman-Monteith's equations are incomplete, and are therefore turned
 off. The WEPP model adequately accounts for seasonal and climatic fluctuations, spatiotemporal
 difference in vegetation, and physiographic differences. Recommended improvements to the WEPP
 model's ET routine are: 1) completing the coding of the Penman-Monteith equation, 2) computing
 evaporation of intercepted precipitation, and 3) computing evaporation from water bodies and litter.

$Title=Effectiveness of needle cast at reducing erosion after forest fires
$Year=2003
$Authors= Pannkuk, Robichaud
$category=fire
$Publisher=WRR
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Needle cast from partially burnt conifer trees commonly occurs after forest fires.
  The effectiveness of needles in reducing soil erosion was investigated in this study.
  Two needle types, ponderosa pine and Douglas fir needles, were used at four different cover amounts (0, 15, 40, and 70 percent) on granitic and volcanic derived soils.
  Simulated rainfall was used to examine interrill erosion; added inflow was used to determine rill erosion in a laboratory setting.
  After a series of "runs," data showed that sediment delivery was greater for the granitic soil compared with the volcanic soil.
  Douglas fir needles were more effective at reducing interrill erosion compared with the ponderosa pine needles.
  Ponderosa pine needles, because of their shape and being bundled together, often caused minidebris dams to form.
  The minidebris dams formed by ponderosa pine needles reduce flow within the rill, resulting in less rill erosion than the Douglas fir needles.
  A 50 percent cover of Douglas fir needles reduced interrill erosion by 80 percent and rill erosion 20 by percent.
  A 50 percent cover of ponderosa pine needles reduced interrill erosion by 60 percent and rill erosion by 40 percent.
  We also compared the effectiveness of using stream power, rather than shear stress, to model rill erosion.
  Stream power was a better predictor of sediment load than shear stress.
  Rill detachment rates based on stream power decreased with increasing cover for both needle types.
  These results challenge the use of shear stress detachment rates in current erosion models and provide insight into the use of stream power detachment rates.

$Year=2003
$Authors=Robichaud
$category=fire
$Publisher=ARS
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Wildfire is an important ecological process and
  management issue on western rangelands. Major
  unknowns associated with wildfire are its affects on
  vegetation and soil conditions that influence
  hydrologic processes including infiltration, surface
  runoff, erosion, sediment transport, and flooding.
  Post wildfire hydrologic response was studied in big
  sagebrush plant communities on steep slopes with
  coarse-textured soils. Significant rill erosion was
  observed following both thunderstorm and rapid
  snowmelt events. Rainfall simulation and controlled
  overland flow techniques were used to study post-fire
  effects on infiltration, and interrill and rill
  erosion processes on burned and adjacent unburned
  areas. Results indicate that burn severity and the
  development of water repellent soil conditions play
  significant roles in determining infiltration and
  interrill erosion rates, particularly on shrub coppice
  dunes characterized by high surface litter
  accumulations. The most dramatic and long-lasting
  affect of fire was on rill erosion processes by
  reducing ground cover needed to slow and spread
  water as it moves across the soil surface. Ongoing
  research efforts are aimed at characterizing the
  hydrologic impacts of prescribed fire used as a tool
  to manage vegetation and mitigate the impacts of
  catastrophic wildfire events.

$Abstract=Increased runoff and erosion commonly occur after wildfires with the onset of precipitation events.
  Various erosion mitigation treatments are often used after wildfires to reduce flooding and sedimentation.
  The effectiveness of these treatments has not been well documented in the literature;
  therefore we undertook a rapid response approach (within four weeks following fire suppression) to install
  small catchment monitoring systems to compare treatment effectiveness.
  A paired watershed approach uses two adjacent and similar catchments (5-20 ac) after wildfires,
  treating one catchment and using the other catchment as a control.
  We developed a rapid response monitoring system that can be installed in a few weeks to monitor sediment yield and
  runoff response.
  These systems are usually left in place for three to five years. 
  <br><br>
  Each installation has a complete weather station and electronic measuring devices to record streamflow and
  sediment accumulation in a storage basin.
  The sediment basins are cleaned out manually after each storm event in order to relate the event
  (intensity, amount and duration) to runoff and sediment yield.
  The data is automatically transmitted each day via cell phone or radio transmission to our computer server,
  thus making the data available daily on our web page.
  We have installed six paired catchments to date in Colorado, Washington, two in California, and two in Montana.
  Preliminary results suggest that
  1) first year storm events produce the largest runoff and sediment response and
  2) treatment effectiveness is less with high intensity short duration storm events.
  This rapid response protocol allows for quick installation of a monitoring system to provide
  an assessment of treatment effectiveness.

$abstract=
  Our team was asked to analyze and comment on the
  existing knowledge and science related to postfire
  rehabilitation treatments, with particular emphasis
  on the known effectiveness of these treatments.
  The general effects of fire on Western forested landscapes
  are well documented (Agee 1993; DeBano and others
  1998; Kozlowski and Ahlgren 1974) and have been
  thoroughly discussed in other chapters of this report.
  However, postfire erosion and rehabilitation treatment
  effectiveness have not been studied extensively.
  <br><br>
  The first part of this chapter describes the postfire
  conditions, as identified by the Burned Area Emergency Rehabilitation (BAER) team,
  and the subsequent BAER team recommendations for rehabilitation treatment.
  The next sections describe the different treatments, where they were applied on the Hayman
  Fire burn area, and the current knowledge of treatment effectiveness.
  The recommendations for monitoring treatment effectiveness will answer the specific question,
  "What types of monitoring protocol and reports should Forest Service and other jurisdictions
  put in place to continue to learn from this fire?"
  and outline a general process for monitoring postfire rehabilitation efforts.
  This is followed by a description of the sites currently established within the
  Hayman Fire burned area to evaluate the effectiveness of various rehabilitation treatments.
  The need to establish control sites (burned but not treated) to
  provide a basis for comparison and monitor natural recovery is also discussed.
  The final section identifies the knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to
  guide the selection of postfire rehabilitation treatments on future fires in the Colorado Front Range
  and similar environments.

$Abstract=The Rocky Mountain Research Station and the Willamette National Forest
  performed a study to investigate the sediment production of several aggregates.
  Nine basalts, three quartzites, two welded tuffs, two alluvial, and one each
  of glacial outwash and limestone were tested.
  The sediment production from the most erodible aggregate was 100 times that
  of the least erodible; a large range that should be considered when choosing
  aggregate surfacing material.

$Title=Wood strands as an alternative to agricultural straw for erosion control

$authorblock= *** moved to 2004r ***
$Abstract=Agricultural straw is used in forested areas of the United States for
  erosion control on burned areas, harvest landings, decommissioned road prisms,
  road cuts and fills, and other areas of disturbed soil.
  Two blends of wood strands were statistically equal to straw in
  reducing both runoff and sediment production.
  Both the straw and each of the wood fiber mixes reduced erosion by 98 percent
  as compared to the bare soil.
  This result implies that wood fibers are an acceptable alternative to
  agricultural straw in erosion control applications.
  Further work is underway to determine optimum width and length mixes,
  application rates, and decomposition rates for the wood fibers.

$Title=The challenges in developing the WEPP cumulative effects model

$Authors=Elliot, Foltz

$authorblock=
$Abstract=Many of the forests in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world are
  source areas for water.
  The quantity and quality of this water are major public concerns.
  In a forested watershed, any road segment, harvesting operation, or other
  management activity can adversely impact forest streams.
  These disturbances are distributed in both time and space.
  THe disturbance in the first year may have minimal impact on the hydrologic
  integrity of the watershed, but if the disturbance in the following year
  is added to the first, and the disturbance in year th3 added to those in
  years 1 and 2, the net effect may be detrimental to the beneficial uses
  of the stream.
  A model to address this cumulative impact is sometimes refered to as a
  cumulative effects model.
  This paper presents the application of the GeoWEPP Geographic Information
  System (GIS) tool to evaluating cumulative effects in forests due to fuel
  management activities.
  An example is given to demonstrate the utility and limitations of the
  current tool.

$Abstract=This study assesses the accuracy of GeoWEPP model (Geospatial Water Erosion
Prediction Project) and a modified version of WEPP for forest soils. Three small
watersheds (2-9 ha) in the Interior Northwest were monitored for several years following
timber harvest and prescribed fires. Observed site factors of climate variables, percent
ground cover and soil erodibility values, along with digital slope data were used to drive
the models. The GeoWEPP and WEPP model predictions of runoff and sediment yield
were compared to observed yearly totals from each watershed. Monthly totals were also
compared the results of the modified version of WEPP. The yearly results showed that
GeoWEPP under-predicts runoff and sediment and the results were not acceptable at a 90
percent confidence interval. The same data was tested with the modified version of
WEPP containing modified algorithms for deep percolation and subsurface lateral flow
intended to better represent forest hydrology. This modified version of the WEPP model
showed improvements to yearly predictions of runoff and sediment over the GeoWEPP
model and generated acceptable results of runoff and sediment. Monthly values of runoff
and sediment yield generated by the modified WEPP generated acceptable results
compared to the observed monthly values. The GeoWEPP model has the potential to
model erosion with the incorporation of digital elevation data, but lacks the ability to
accurately represent forest hydrology. The incorporation of a WEPP algorithm that
represent forest soils more realistically would improve the results of GeoWEPP
predictions.

$Abstract=The summer of 2002 was one of the worst fire seasons in history, especially for the
 state of Colorado where the Hayman Fire burned nearly 60,000 ha. Almost a third of the
 fire was classified as a high severity burn, which often translates into a high erosion
 potential. After a fire, soils are frequently rendered water repellent due to the burning of
 vegetation and surface organic matter. Two methods of testing water repellent soils were
 performed on the Hayman Fire, the traditional water drop penetration time (WDPT) test
 and a new mini-disk infiltrometer test. The ability of these two methods to identify water
 repellent soils in relation to burn severity was tested as well as the compatibility between
 the tests. The moderately burned sites exhibited the strongest and most persistent water
 repellency according to both WDPT and infiltrometer tests. The WDPT and infiltrometer
 values were correlated for each individual burn severity class as well as overall. As the
 infiltrometer is still in experimental stages, we recommend both tests be used for method
 comparison and evaluation.
 <br><br>
 After evaluation of the ground data, a hyperspectral image that was acquired after
 the fire was analyzed in an attempt to remotely identify soil water repellency. Remote
 detection of organic matter in soils has been studied extensively and wavebands that were
 previously identified as useful were analyzed for spectral features indicative of water
 repellency. No features were found to correlate well with soil water repellency, mostly
 because of the overall dampening the blackness from the fire had on soil spectral
 signatures. A supervised classification was run with the mean spectral signatures of low,
 moderate and high water repellency soils as endmembers. The accuracy of the
 classification for identifying the degree of severity of soil water repellency was low, but
 the ability to identify the presence of soil water repellency was nearly 80 percent.
 According to the classification, approximately 20 percent of the Hayman Fire was at a high
 risk for soil erosion, and these are the areas on which erosion mitigation should be focused.

$Title=GPS-assisted road surveys and GIS-based road erosion modeling using the WEPP model
$Year=2003
$Authors=Elliot
$category=roads
$Publisher=ASAE
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Roads have been identified as a major source of sediment loading to streams in most forested watersheds.
 The Watershed Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, as developed by the USDA-Forest Service,
 simulates the detachment and delivery of sediment through a road, fill, and buffer system.
 Time and budget constraints typically prevent a comprehensive sediment loading analysis using the
 WEPP model throughout a large watershed.
 We describe a step-by-step approach to allow use of the WEPP model to simulate erosion throughout a large road network.
 Road attributes are acquired from detailed global positioning system-assisted road surveys and mapped in a
 geographic information system (GIS).
 After data manipulation in GIS and Excel, the required input files for the WEPP model are developed.
 The approach was applied to 1017&nbsp;km of road, divided into 6955 road segments, throughout a 3040&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>
 watershed, ranging in elevation from 377&nbsp;m to 2706&nbsp;m.
 The approach can be applied to insloped, outsloped, and crowned road designs, multiple climate regimes,
 and unique physical attributes for each road segment.
 Analysis of the WEPP results within a GIS provides a spatially explicit tool for the management and evaluation
 of sediment production throughout large road networks.

$Abstract=Agricultural straw is widely used as an erosion mitigation measure on disturbed soils.
  It has several drawbacks, however, which include increasing intrinsic value,
  increasing transportatin costs, weed source, pesticide residues, and dust.
  An alternative is wood  strands manufactured from small diameter timber or
  low-value veneer.
  A study to determine the efficacy of wood strands as an alternative to straw
  showed that straw and two types of wood strands were equally effective in
  reducing erosion by over 98%.
  The authors believe that there are opportunities to exceed the erosion
  control performance of agricultural straw through the disciplined design
  of a wood analog.
  Work is continuing to improve the wood strand properties for further field
  testing.

$authorblock=
$Abstract=Road obliteration, the process of removing culverts, restoring stream
 gradient, and recontouring the road to match the hillside, is one of the tools
 to deal with excess forest roads.
 After road obliteration former stream crossings are locations where sediment
 travel distances to the aquatic environment are short.
 A study to determine the infiltration characteristics and raindrop splash
 characteristics found that infiltrationw as approximately 10 mm/h for former
 roads that had been obliterated for 2 to 3 years.
 This value was less than typical forest floor values of 80 mm/h, but greater
 than road ones of 2 mm/h.
 Raindrop splash coefficients of 2.5 x 10<sup>6</sup> kg s / m<sup>4</sup> were
 closer to road than to forest floor conditions.
 Even though the increase in infiltration was modest, an improvement from 2 to
 10 mm/h, results of WEPP model predictions of runoff events from 30 years
 of simulated climate indicated a large reduction in the number of runoff events
 from both rainfall as well as snowmelt events.

$Abstract=This paper reviews the environmental impacts of forest roads at the on-site and the
 watershed scale. The components of a road prism--the cut slopem ditch, running
 surface, and fill slope--are defined and a description of the infiltration and flow
 processes are made for both insloped and outsloped roads. The perceived advantages
 of both are discussed. Flow on the road prism without traffic and a long-term study of
 the sediment production also follow. Some of the differences in sediment production
 between traffic and no-traffic conditions are highlighted, and the results of three
 studies of sediment production from roads with traffic are also discussed. Two
 methods to mitigate the impact of road traffic are reviewed. At the watershed scale,
 two studies that used the same data, but reached opposing conclusions are discussed.
 There is also a review of a study investigating the connection of a road system and
 stream network. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research on both
 on-site and watershed scales.

$Abstract=Selection of suitable locally available materials to build strong and
durable roads with aggregate surfaces is desired to minimize road construction
and maintenance costs and to minimize the detrimental
effects of sedimentation. Eighteen aggregates were selected from local
sources in Idaho, Oregon, South Dakota, and Washington State.
Aggregate was placed in shallow metal frames and compacted to simulate
a forest road. The levels of runoff and sediment from a high-intensity,
long-duration simulated rainstorm were measured. The
material tests selected for use in the study included ones that define
the basic characteristics of the aggregate, along with a number of tests
intended to predict susceptibility to erosion. Each of the tests was statistically
evaluated to identify those that best predicted the perceived
aggregate quality. The two best indicators of aggregate quality were
the results of the sand equivalent test and the P20 portion of the Oregon
air degradation test. The best indicator of either runoff or sediment
production was the fraction passing the 0.6-mm sieve. Acceptable
aggregates, both those of good quality and those of marginal quality,
exhibited a 2-order-of-magnitude range in both runoff and sediment
production.

$Abstract=Mass failure is one of the most common failures of low-volume roads in
 mountainous terrain. Current methods for evaluating stability of these
 roads require a geotechnical specialist. A stability analysis program,
 XSTABL, was used to estimate the stability of 3,696 combinations of
 road geometry, soil, and groundwater conditions. A sensitivity analysis
 was carried out to find the most important site-specific variables in estimating
 slope stability, and two regression equations were developed to
 predict the factor of safety (FS) for a given road, one with the ground-water
 below the road fill and one with the groundwater in the road fill.
 The resulting equations predicted failures on road segments where failures
 were observed to have occurred. A comparison of the predicted FSs
 from the regression equations with the FS values predicted by the infinite
 slope equation showed that both methods predicted similar FSs.

   Fort Worth, TX. ASAE Publication Number 701P0102. p. 554-559.
$abstract=Water quality laws require regulatory agencies to identify the beneficial uses of streams and rivers,
   and to determine the pollutants that may impair those uses.
   The amount of pollutant that can be tolerated for a given beneficial use is the total maximum daily load (TMDL).
   In forest watersheds, sediment is generally the greatest pollutant.
   Sediment sources include surface erosion from forested hillslopes and roads, mass failure, and channel erosion.
   <br><br>
   One of the questions managers are seeking to answer is how to relate forest practices to sediment loads.
   The purpose of this paper is to present a tool that can predict daily sediment delivery to forest streams,
   and to discuss the implications of its application.

  Presented at the Geological Society of America
  2002 Denver Annual Meeting,
  <i>Geomorphic Impacts of Wildfire I</i>,
  October 27-30, 2002, Colorado Convention Center, Denver, CO.
  Paper No. 143-10.
$Abstract=Wildfire is a major ecological process and management issue in the western U.S.
 The 2000, 2001 and 2002 fire seasons were some of the biggest in history with over 2 million ha burned annually.
 What happens when the rains come? Most wildfires create a patchwork of low, moderate, and high severity burn areas, often causing spatially varied hydrologic surface conditions.
 Severely burned areas often have increased erosion due to loss of the protective forest floor layer and loss of water storage as well as creation of water repellent soil conditions.
 Erosion is a natural process occurring at varying rates and scales depending on soil type, topography, vegetation, climate and type of disturbance.
 Erosion rates in a forest environment are generally small except when the ground surface is disturbed by human or natural causes.
 First year surface erosion rates after the Bitterroot Valley, Montana wildfires indicate that short duration high intensity thunderstorms (10-min max. intensity 75 mm/hr) caused the highest erosion rates (2 to 40 t/ha), whereas the long duration low intensity rain events produced little erosion (0.01 t/ha).
  <br><br>
 To control erosion and flooding potential, post-fire rehabilitation treatments are commonly used.
 Some mitigation treatments may help reduce erosion for some rain events but not all events.
 Using low-intensity rainfall simulation techniques we compared three common post-fire emergency rehabilitation 
 treatments--contour-felled logs, straw wattles, and hand trenches--at reducing erosion as compared to non-treated areas.
 The straw wattles and contour-felled logs reduce erosion by 70 percent for these small rain events.
 But during intense summer thunderstorms (40 mm/hr, 10-min max intensity) there were smaller differences between treatments with the straw wattles showing the most reduction in erosion.
 Other laboratory studies suggest that brown needles that commonly fall to the ground after low and moderate severity burns may reduce rill erosion by 30 to 40 percent and interrill erosion by 50 to 70 percent.

$abstract=Our team has been asked to review and comment on immediate postfire effects.
 Specifically, we were asked to review the existing knowledge and science on changes
  in watershed responses and effectiveness of postfire rehabilitation treatments.
 We will review monitoring protocols and techniques related to erosion, water
  quality, and treatment effectiveness that are appropriate for burned areas.
 Additionally, we will identify appropriate untreated areas that should be established
  to allow meaningful comparison to natural recovery.
 Finally, we will identify knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to guide the selection of
  postfire rehabilitation treatments.
 <br><br>
 Our approach first builds on the current literature pertaining to postfire changes in watershed
  response and sedimentation.
 Then we describe the soils, hydrology, values at risk, and selection of treatment methods
  for the Hayman Fire area.
 This is followed by current knowledge of postfire rehabilitation treatment effectiveness with
  a focus on treatments that are being used on the Hayman Fire area.
 We continue with a discussion of monitoring protocols.
 We finish by delineating the shortfalls in our knowledge and the uncertainty we have in the
  effectiveness of the rehabilitation treatments currently being used.

$Abstract=The WEPP model is a daily runoff and erosion prediction model.  We propose the use of 
 this model to predict peak runoff rates from forested watersheds.  We compared Curve Number 
 methods to WEPP prediction methods.  Both methods predicted similar 2-hr precipitation amounts,
 which were similar to observed values.  Both methods underpredicted 24-hr runoff amounts, but 
 WEPP more closely predicted peak runoff rates.

$Abstract=Measuring hillslope erosion has historically been a costly, time-consuming practice. An easy to
 install low-cost technique using silt fences (geotextile fabric) and tipping bucket rain gauges to measure
 onsite hillslope erosion was developed and tested. Equipment requirements, installation procedures, statistical
 design, and analysis methods for measuring hillslope erosion are discussed. The use of silt fences is
 versatile; various plot sizes can be used to measure hillslope erosion in different settings and to determine
 effectiveness of various treatments or practices. Silt fences are installed by making a sediment trap facing
 upslope such that runoff cannot go around the ends of the silt fence. The silt fence is folded to form a pocket
 for the sediment to settle on and reduce the possibility of sediment undermining the silt fence. Cleaning out
 and weighing the accumulated sediment in the field can be accomplished with a portable hanging or platform
 scale at various time intervals depending on the necessary degree of detail in the measurement of
 erosion (that is, after every storm, quarterly, or seasonally). Silt fences combined with a tipping bucket rain
 gauge provide an easy, low-cost method to quantify precipitation/hillslope erosion relationships. Trap efficiency
 of the silt fences is greater that 90 percent, thus making them suitable for use in estimating hillslope erosion.

$Title=The effects of log erosion barriers on post-fire hydrological response and sediment yield in small forested watersheds, southern California

   <b>Hydrological Processes</b> 15(15): 3053-3066.
$Abstract=Wildfire usually promotes flooding and accelerated erosion in upland watersheds. In the summer of 1999, a high-severity
wildfire burned a series of mixed pine/oak headwater catchments in the San Jacinto Mountains of southern California.
Log erosion barriers (LEBs) were constructed across much of the burned area as an erosion control measure. We
built debris basins in two watersheds, each about 1 ha in area, one with LEBs, the other without, to measure post-fire
hydrologic response and sediment yield and to evaluate the effectiveness of the LEBs. The watersheds are underlain
by granitic bedrock, producing a loamy sand soil above large extents of weathered bedrock and exposed core stones
(tors) on the surface. Measured soil water-repellency was similar over the two catchments. Rain gauges measured
348 mm of precipitation in the first post-fire year. The ephemeral stream channels experienced surface flow after
major rainstorms, and the source of the water was throughflow exfiltration at the slope/channel interface. Post-fire
overland flow produced some rilling, but hillslope erosion measured in silt fences away from any LEBs was minor,
as was sediment accumulation behind the LEBs. Stream channels in the catchments exhibited minor net scour. Water
yield was much greater in the LEB-treated watershed. This resulted in 14 times more sediment yield by weight than
the untreated watershed. Average soil depths determined by augering were nearly double in the catchment without the
LEBs compared with the treated watershed. This suggests that differences in water and sediment yield between the two
catchments are due to the twofold difference in the estimated soil water-holding capacity in the untreated watershed. It
appears that the deeper soils in the untreated watershed were able to retain most of the precipitation, releasing less water
to the channels and thereby reducing erosion and sediment yield. Thus, the test of LEB effectiveness was inconclusive
in this study, because soil depth and soil water-holding capacity may have masked their performance.

$Abstract=Wildfire is a major ecological process and management issue on western rangelands.
 The impacts of wildfire on hydrologic processes such as infiltration, runoff, and erosion are not well understood.
 Small-plot rainfall simulation methods were applied in a rangeland wildfire setting to determine post-fire hydrologic response.
 Infiltration and interrill erosion processes were measured immediately post-fire and one year following the 1999
 34 400 ha Denio fire in northwestern Nevada.
 Plot-scale spatial and temporal variability in fire impacts was compared with adjacent unburned areas.
 An index of water repellency was derived and used to quantify the influence of water-repellent soil conditions on infiltration.
 Results indicate the impact of the fire on infiltration was localized primarily on coppice microsites directly under shrubs
 characterized by high surface litter accumulations.
 Coppice microsites had very uniform fireinduced soil water repellency with 29 of 30 plots exhibiting at least a
 10% reduction in initial infiltration with an average 28% reduction.
 Cumulative erosion was nearly four times higher on burned coppices compared with unburned coppices.
 The impact of the fire on infiltration and erosion was reduced, but still evident, 1 year after fire.
 Significant temporal variability in infiltration between years was observed on both burned and unburned areas,
 complicating the interpretation of fire impacts and hydrologic recovery following wildfire.

$Abstract=Several severe wildfire seasons increased awareness of the role of fire in healthy ecosystems. Research has
focused not only on fire, but also on its effect on ecosystem components and indicators, such as soils, water
quality, and forest health. Precipitation events after wildfires may cause high sediment inputs to streams,
destruction of aquatic habitat and downstream flooding, all of which may be part of the natural ecosystem
response. If, however, fires are more severe due to past fire suppression and land management activities,
then their impact may be greater than under natural conditions. Fire and erosion are both natural processes
that have been impacted by land management activities such as fire suppression, logging, grazing, and road
building during the last century. Regardless of past management activities, increases in runoff, erosion and
sediment yields are of great concern, since they likely will have some downstream effect.
<br>
The ending of the 2000 fire season was a perfect backdrop for the 2000 American Geophysical Union fall
meeting and special session <i>Wildfire and Surficial Processes.</i> Many researchers have started projects looking
at the effects of fire from a hydrological and surficial perspective during the last 5 years. We wanted to capture
and disseminate the new knowledge to aid in management decision-making and to suggest research directions
for future fire events. This issue contains a selection of papers presented during the meeting.
<br>
The issue begins with articles addressing the fire-induced water repellency of soils in both laboratory and
field studies. Letey reviews various methods to assess water-repellent soil conditions and discusses waterentry
pressure as an alternative indicator of water-repellent soils. Huffman <i>et al.</i> compare two techniques to
determine the degree of water repellency after prescribed fire and wildfires in the Colorado Front Range.
<br>
Several infiltration and runoff studies at the hillslope scale are presented. Martin and Moody show
differences in infiltration rates from high burn severity areas to adjacent unburned areas in ponderosa pine
forests. Pierson <i>et al.</i> indicate that range wildfires can reduce infiltration by 28% in the first year, but only
on the areas under the burnt shrubs and not in the interspace areas. In a computer simulation exercise,
Beeson <i>et al.</i> explore the spatial occurrence of overland flow after fire and map a landscape's vulnerability
to post-fire effects. Benavides-Solorio and MacDonald do not detect differences in runoff between burned
and unburned areas on the Colorado Front Range, but do detect an order-of-magnitude difference in sediment
yields. Johansen <i>et al.</i> show that runoff doubled between burned and unburned plots and sediment yields were
20 times higher in a ponderosa pine forest near Los Alamos, New Mexico.
<br>
At the watershed scale, McLin <i>et al.</i> use the HEC model to predict fire-triggered changes in floodplain
geometry. Moody and Martin use channel cross-sections to evaluate the depositional and erosive features
after a wildfire. With the help of a GIS-based model, Wilson et al. predict an order-of-magnitude increase in
erosion and sedimentation.
<br>
Cannon <i>et al.</i> examine immediate fire-related debris flows after the Los Alamos fires, which indicate
threshold conditions for debris flow to occur, whereas Meyer <i>et al.</i> evaluate historic fire-related debris flows
in the Idaho Batholith. Elliot and Parker use stratigraphic and geomorphic evidence in evaluating alluvial
deposits. They use this information to develop recurrence probabilities for fire&ndash;flood sequences.

$Abstract=A model for spatial prediction of landslide hazard is applied to an experimental basin
 affected by landslide events that occurred during the winter of 1995-96, following heavy rains,
 snowmelt, and high river flow. High-resolution digital elevation data with 75 ft x 75 ft resolution
 were used for deriving the topographic attributes used for the modeling. The model is based on
 multivariate methods and assumes that the factors which caused the failure in the past, would
 cause a failure in the future under similar conditions. This model is intended for predicting
 future slope failure when managing forestlands where the major concern is associated with the
 cumulative effects on the entire watershed, such as decreased water quality, loss of spawning
 habitat and organic matter, flowing debris during peak flows, and decision support for road
 maintenance, obliteration, and development of new roads. 
 This type of model allows rapid assessment of spatial correlation of the topographic
 attributes on large areas. The final product of the modeled prediction would delineate areas with
 high probabilities of failure in the basin. At the end the modeled prediction is compared with the
 observed landslide locations to test the strength of the model.

$Abstract=Soil erosion by water is a complex process resulting from the interactions among a number of factors including weather patterns, soil properties, topography, and the influences of surface vegetation.
  Natural variability is a dominant characteristic of each of these factors, which makes predicting soil erosion rates difficult.
  In many forest conditions, and some rangeland conditions, erosion may be minimal under vegetated conditions unless the site is disturbed.
  Disturbances may be fire, logging, grazing, or severe precipitation events.
  The most extreme erosion rates occur when severe weather follows a major disturbance, particularly a severe wildfire. 
  <br><br>
  We are developing an interface to aid in the analysis of erosion prediction following fire, or a similar major disturbance, in forests and rangelands.
  This paper addresses how we intend to incorporate the inherent variability associated with the predicted erosion rate, and how that variability is influenced by weather, spatial distribution of disturbances, and soil properties.

$Abstract= In the years following a major forest disturbance, such as fire, the erosion rate is greatly influenced by variability in weather, in soil properties,
    and in spatial distribution. This paper presents a method to incorporate these variabilities into the erosion rate predicted by the Water Erosion Prediction
    Project model. It appears that it is not necessary to describe both the soil and the vegetation effects of the disturbance. Incorporating the vegetation effects
    on soil erodibility, and its associated variability, is sufficient--when combined with weather and spatial variability--to predict the probabilities of single storm
    and annual soil erosion rates in the years following the disturbance. By redefining the probability distributions of the soils, erosion during the recovering years
    and impacts of mitigation on erosion can be determined from the same initial set of computer runs.

$Abstract=A study to determine the infiltration parameters for filter windrows was undertaken. The study used a flow
 rate representing the runoff from a forest road of 100 m length during a storm of 50 mm/hr. Observations
 during the flow event suggested a hydrophobic-like condition existed for up to 10 minutes. The hydraulic
 conductivity required by the WEPP model to reproduce the field results ranged from 80 to 200 mm/hr in the
 filter windrow and from 60 to 1400 mm/hr in the forest floor. While the 1400 mm/hr value appeared to be due
 to macropores, hydraulic conductivity values of 400 mm/hr for the forest floor were required for proper WEPP
 simulation. These values will be incorporated in the U.S. Forest Service WEPP Road interface.

$Abstract=Renewed interest in land management practices, such as conservation tillage techniques on agricultural lands and
 timber harvesting, prescribed fires and wildfires on forested lands, has made it desirable to measure hillslope soil erosion.
 Measuring soil erosion is generally costly and time consuming requiring expensive equipment, many site
 visits and laboratory analyses. The objective of the study was to determine the suitability of silt fences for measuring
 onsite hillslope erosion. Silt fences are low-cost and easy to install. They commonly are used as an erosion control
 device for construction projects and therefore generally available. For this study a silt fence was installed at the base
 of an existing long-term hillslope erosion plot at the Agricultural Research Service's Palouse Conservation Field
 Station at Pullman, WA. Two seasons of erosion data were collected. The silt fence was installed by making a
 cavity facing upslope such that runoff could not go around the silt fence. Also, the silt fence was folded
 to form a pocket to collect the sediment and eliminate the possibility of undermining the silt fence. Silt fences were
 installed across the width of the plot. The trap efficiency was determined by measuring the collected runoff and
 sediment that flowed through the silt fence compared to the sediment trapped by the silt fence. Results indicate that
 the mean trap efficiency was 93 percent the first year when measured on a storm-by-storm basis and 92 percent
 efficient the second year when only measured at the end of the runoff season. Thus various time intervals can be
 used depending of the detail of the erosion rates that are of interest, for example after every storm or seasonally
 without compromising its trap efficiency.

$Abstract=Rangeland runoff and erosion rates are highly dependent on the type and amount of vegetative cover as well
 as climate and topography. Three rangeland erosion prediction models--RUSLE, WEPP for rangelands, and FS&nbsp;WEPP
 for rangelands--were compared to observed sedimentation rates on five small southeastern Colorado
 watersheds. RUSLE and the FS&nbsp;WEPP interface gave predictions similar to the observed values for
 sedimentation. The WEPP rangeland templates underpredicted erosion and overpredicted runoff. Both
 versions of WEPP were able to predict runoff as a function of upland topography and vegetation, making future
 development of more complex rangeland watershed sedimentation prediction feasible.

$Abstract=The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is a state-of-the-art soil erosion model applicable to a
 wide range of vegetation, soil, and climatic conditions. The CLIGEN weather generator is distributed with WEPP.
 The CLIGEN database contained some errors and did not include many climate stations in
 mountainous areas where most forests are located and where climate is highly variable. Errors in the database
 were identified and corrected. The database was expanded from 1,100 stations to more than 2,600. In addition,
 the ability to modify the statistics for a climate station has been developed to allow users to enter their own
 weather station statistics into a web-based computer interface. Users can enter specific values, change existing
 values by a percentage, modify the annual amount, or adjust temperatures with elevation. The PRISM monthly
 precipitation database was incorporated into the interface to aid users in predicting climates at remote sites. The
 designated changes are made to an existing CLIGEN parameter file to generate a modified climate file. The
 modified climate file may be selected for use with a Forest Service WEPP interface, or it may be used to
 generate a climate file for use with the WEPP model. The enhancements can be accessed from a web site.

$Abstract=Wildfire and forest operations remove vegetation and disturb forest soils.
	Both of these effects can lead to an increased risk of soil erosion. Operations to reduce
	forest fuel loads, however, may reduce the risk of wildfire. This paper presents research
	and modeling results which show that under many conditions, carefully planned operations,
	with adequate buffers, result in lower long-term erosion rates than those experienced following
	wildfire, which is inevitable if fuel loads are not reduced. The effects of reducing
	fire-induced flood flows on forest stream systems, however, are unknown.

$Abstract=Soil erosion models have been under development since the late 1930s. Technologies for
	prediction began with simple tables and equations culminating in the 1950s with the Universal Soil Loss Equation.
	In the 1960s, digital computers allowed scientists to model the processes that cause erosion.
	These early models required complex databases and a high degree of user skill to operate; therefore they were used
	primarily by the research community. One such process-based erosion model is the Water Erosion Prediction
	Project (WEPP) model. The USDA Forest Service wanted to use WEPP but found, following a number
	of workshops, that the model was too complex for field specialists to use. To capture the scientific
	capabilities of WEPP for Forest Service users, specialized interfaces were developed (using HTML, Perl and
	JavaScript) to allow users to run WEPP over the Internet using a standard browser. Alternatively,
	with the addition of a small web server application, the same specialized interfaces and erosion and climate
	models can be installed on personal computers for users without Internet access. The user generates site
	characterization data and climate data by running the CLIGEN program using several large climate databases.
	These data are used by the WEPP erosion model to predict runoff, upland erosion, and hillslope sediment
	delivery. The displays of the results from the WEPP model are designed to meet user needs. These interfaces
	to WEPP are rapidly gaining acceptance by specialists in the Forest Service and many other agencies and
	universities. Similar interfaces are under development for cropland and rangeland applications of the WEPP
	model and for slope stability modeling.

$Abstract=Fuel and land management activities in the past
	century have placed wildland values such as soil and water quality at greater risk due to increased soil erosion.
	Eroded sediment can lead to decreased long-term soil productivity and can adversely impact aquatic ecosystems.
	Higher runoff rates from severely burned landscapes can lead to flooding and increased risk to human life and property.
	Over the past ten years, we have completed studies on eight sites in the Northwestern and Southeastern U.S. measuring erosion impacts associated with prescribed burning.
	We are now carrying out field and laboratory studies addressing knowledge gaps in our understanding of
	fuel management practices on soil erosion, and developing a user-friendly computer interface 
	to evaluate the risk and consequences of erosion hazards following wildfires, mitigation treatments,
	and prescribed burns. Specific tasks that we are addressing include: determining hillslope
	characteristics that govern dry ravel processes such as slope steepness, vegetation density, soil texture
	and disturbance impacts; determining the spatial and temporal variability in infiltration and erosion
	parameters needed to predict overland flow and soil detachment after wildfire; quantifying effectiveness
	of three mitigation practices in reducing sediment production for specified design storms following
	wildfires; and evaluating measured erosion rates and estimates of sediment production after wildfires at
	the upland watershed/catchment scale. Data collection has begun from a burned-over catchment
	and preliminary results are presented. Additional discussion addresses methodologies and
	approaches to evaluate and model erosion risk and hazard.

$Abstract=Wildfires in steep forest environments can often produce disasterous runoff and soil loss after rainstorms.
  There is often needle cast from partially burnt conifer trees that generally falls to the soil surface within several months after the fire.
  These needles offer protection from soil erosion that is not fully understood.
  A laboratory experiment was conducted using rainfall simulation to determine the interaction of needle type and percent cover on soil erosion.
  Results indicate that needle type and percent cover greatly impact soil erosion processes.
  A log-decay relationship provided a good fit of the data.
  These relationships will be useful for the assessment of erosion potential after forest fires from a practical as well as a modeling standpoint.

$Abstract=Following wildfires, burned areas are assessed by special teams to determine whether emergency watershed rehabilitation measures are required to restore watershed function and minimize damage to soil resources.
  The objective of burned area emergency rehabilitation (BAER) treatments is to restore watershed condition and reduce erosional losses on hillslopes, in channels, and on road surfaces and peripheral areas such as ditches.
  In the Western United States, a project is currently in progress to determine the costs and effectiveness of BAER projects in restoring watershed function.
  Results of this project will help establish the future directions of the BAER program into the 21st century. <BR>

$Abstract=Increased awareness of the role of fire in healthy ecosystems has focused attention on some of the effects of fires, wild and prescribed, on watershed condition and health.
  Precipitation events after forest fires may cause high sediment inputs, destruction of aquatic habitat and downstream flooding, all of which may be part of the natural ecosystem response.
  However, if the fires are more severe due to past fire suppression activities, then the fire effects may be greater than natural.
  Fire and erosion are both natural processes that have been impacted by forest management activities such as fire suppression, logging, and road building during the last century.
  Management activities may contribute to increased streamflows and increased sediment supplies to streams and rivers.
  Additional sediment places streams and rivers at a higher risk for degradation.
  Sediment adversely affects spawning and rearing sites for anadromous and resident fish species, mobilizes in-stream sediment, and destroys aquatic habitat.
  Therefore, various management and mitigation strategies are often devised to reduce the threat of increased sediment.
  This paper reviews the effects of fire on hillslope erosion and the associated risks on watershed health. 
  Fire is a natural and important part of the disturbance regime for forested terrestrial and aquatic systems, especially in the western USA.
  However, much uncertainty exists in quantifying fire effects on ecosystem components such as watershed condition and health.

$Abstract=Spending on postfire emergency watershed rehabilitation has increased during the past decade.
  A west-wide evaluation of USDA Forest Service burned area emergency rehabilitation (BAER) treatment
  effectiveness was undertaken as a joint project by USDA Forest Service Research and National Forest
  System staffs. This evaluation covers 470 fires and 321 BAER projects, from 1973 through 1998 in USDA
  Forest Service Regions 1 through 6. A literature review, interviews with key Regional and Forest BAER
  specialists, analysis of burned area reports, and review of Forest and District monitoring reports were
  used in the evaluation. The study found that spending on rehabilitation has increased to over $48 million
  during the past decade because the perceived threat of debris flows and floods has increased where fires
  are closer to the wildland-urban interface. Existing literature on treatment effectiveness is limited, thus
  making treatment comparisons difficult. The amount of protection provided by any treatment is small.
  Of the available treatments, contour-felled logs show promise as an effective hillslope treatment because
  they provide some immediate watershed protection, especially during the first postfire year. Seeding has
  a low probability of reducing the first season erosion because most of the benefits of the seeded grass
  occurs after the initial damaging runoff events. To reduce road failures, treatments such as properly
  spaced rolling dips, water bars, and culvert reliefs can move water past the road prism. Channel
  treatments such as straw bale check dams should be used sparingly because onsite erosion control is
  more effective than offsite sediment storage in channels in reducing sedimentation from burned
  watersheds. From this review, we recommend increased treatment effectiveness monitoring at the
  hillslope and sub-catchment scale, streamlined postfire data collection needs, increased training on
  evaluation postfire watershed conditions, and development of an easily accessible knowledge base of
  BAER techniques.

$Abstract=Environmental attributes relevant for spatial prediction of landslides triggered by rain and
  snowmelt events were derived from a digital elevation model (DEM). Those data in conjunction
  with statistics and a geographic information system (GIS) provided a detailed basis for spatial
  prediction of landslide hazard. The spatial prediction of landslide hazard in this paper is based on
  discriminant analysis. Discriminant analysis is a multivariate technique that can be used to build
  rules that can classify elements or observations successfully between stable and unstable
  areas. The discriminant rule would show how to take into account the relative risks of making
  errors of misclassification. Those general rules allow managers to consider that errors in one
  direction may be much more costly than errors in the other direction.

$Abstract=The Inland Northwest U.S. has experienced significant and widespread landslide events in recent years.
  This research focuses on the Clearwater National Forest (CWNF) in central Idaho, and outlines the development of datasets, methods, and maps for the spatial prediction of landslide hazard.
  Terrain attributes are directly calculated from digital elevation models (DEMs) and include variables such as elevation, slope, plan and profile curvature, flow path length, and specific catchment area.
  The DEM-derived datasets are combined with a diversity of other digital datasets including climate surfaces, bedrock geology, roads, landslide events, and landcover.
  The datasets are combined in a geographic information system (GIS) for landslide exploration of correlation and statistical model development to predict the probability of occurrence or hazard.
  Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of occurrence in tandem with the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve as a measure of performance of a predictive rule.
  The ROC curve is a plot of the probability of having true positive identified landslides versus the probability of false positive identified landslides as the cut-off probability varies.
  The resulting product may be used for forest planning and decision support for maintenance, obliteration or development of forest roads.
  Predictions of increased local climate variability and extreme events portend that hazard maps are critical for minimizing negative impacts on forest infrastructure and environmental degradation due to sediment pulses and stream course obliteration.

$Abstract=A prime forest resource is clean water for downstream beneficial uses.
 Sediment from forests may impair those beneficial uses. Sedimentation by water erosion is rare unless
 road activities, timber harvesting, or fire disturb the forest. We have been researching
 forest soil erosion processes and developing erosion prediction models for more than 10 years.
 This paper presents an overview of some of our findings.
 <br><br>
 Rut formation dominates road erosion processes. Road maintenance practices that reduce
 rutting also reduce erosion rates. Road ditches can also be a major source of sediment if
 the ditches are recently disturbed from construction or maintenance. Generally, if roads
 are properly designed and located at a sufficient distance from nearby streams, then
 stream sedimentation is minimal.
 <br><br>
 Forest harvesting activities can lead to increased erosion due to the exposure of mineral
 soil or the alteration of soil properties due to compaction. Fires can lead to major erosion
 in forests, especially during the first few years after the fire. Spatial variability of the
 severity of disturbance is common after fire. Fire effects include a reduction in soil
 hydraulic conductivity and a loss of the protective organic layer on the soil surface.
 These two impacts can increase erosion rates by several magnitudes.
 <br><br>
 The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model can model disturbed forest erosion
 processes. WEPP can be a powerful tool to provide quantitative estimates of the amount
 of sediment entering forest streams for many management activities. Templates for the
 current WEPP model and user-friendly interfaces have been developed to assist field
 managers to apply this technology to various forest conditions.

	<b>Journal of Hydrology.</b> 231-232(2000): 220-229.
$Abstract=Infiltration rates in undisturbed forest environments are generally high. These high
 infiltration rates may be reduced when forest management activities such as timber harvesting
 and/or prescribed fires are used. Post-harvest residue burning is a common site preparation
 treatment used in the Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, to reduce forest fuels and to prepare
 sites for natural and artificial tree regeneration. Prescribed burn operations attempt to leave sites
 with the surface condition of a low-severity burn. However, some of the areas often experience
 surface conditions associated with a high-severity burn which may result in hydrophobic or
 water repellent conditions. In this study, infiltration rates were measured after logging slash was
 broadcast burned from two prescribed burns. The two sites were in Northern Rocky mountain coniferous
 forests of Douglas-fir/lodgepole pine and ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir. Simulated rainfall was
 applied to one-square meter plots in three, 30-minute applications at 94 mm hr<sup>-1</sup> within the three
 surface conditions found after the burn: unburned-undisturbed areas, low-severity burn areas and
 high-severity burn areas.
 <br><br>
 Runoff hydrographs from the rainfall simulations were relatively constant from the plots
 that were in unburned-undisturbed areas and in areas subjected to a low-severity burn. These
 constant runoff rates indicate constant hydraulic conductivity values for these surface conditions
 even though there was variation between plots. Hydrographs from the rainfall simulation plots
 located within areas of high-severity burn indicate greater runoff rates than the plots in low-severity
 burn areas especially during the initial stages of the first rainfall event. These runoff
 rates decreased to a constant rate for the last 10 minutes of the event. These results indicate
 hydrophobic or water repellent soil conditions, which temporarily cause a 10 to 40 percent
 reduction in hydraulic conductivity values when compared to a normal infiltrating soil condition.
 Because variability was high for these forest conditions, cumulative distribution algorithms of
 hydraulic conductivity provide a means to account for the inherent variability associated with
 these hillslopes and different surface conditions caused by fire.

$Abstract=Highly variable water repellent soil conditions have been reported after forest fires. We examined
 interactions among heating, soil water content and soil texture on water repellency. Undisturbed, 305-mm
 diameter cores were collected in the field from four soils commonly referred to as ash-cap, mixed ash-cap, no
 ash-cap and granitic soils. Three artificial burning treatments and a control (no heat) and two soil water contents
 were evaluated under laboratory conditions. Twenty water drops were placed on each soil layer starting at the
 surface and continuing at 10 mm intervals to a depth of 70 mm, and the times to infiltrate were recorded. The
 dry control treatment was more water repellent than the wet control treatment. The dry, low heat treatment was
 the most repellent, 10 to 20 mm below the soil surface with mean water drop penetration times greater that 60&nbsp;s.
 Repellency decreased as the heating increased. In wet soils of the high heat treatment, a water repellent layer was
 generally detected 30 to 50 mm below the soil surface. Presumably, hydrophobic substances were translocated
 along the temperature gradient which cooled at depth (&lt; 50 mm) causing condensation on the soil particles.
 Water repellency after prescribed fire would probably be minimal because long heating times are not common.

$Abstract=Most common soil erosion models were developed for agricultural conditions and then modified for rangeland,
	forest, and other applications. Rill and interrill
	erosion generally dominate upland agricultural erosion on recently tilled fields. In
	rangelands, soil is not tilled, rainfall is sporadic, infiltration is high, and the soil
	surface is covered by vegetation residues and sometimes rocks. Recent research has
	shown that as rangeland plant species change from the tall grass species that once
	dominated many plant communities, to short grass species through overgrazing, the
	hydraulic conductivity of the soil decreases and runoff increases. The net impact of
	the rangeland surface and plant changes is that upland erosion may be low, and the
	dominant source of sediment from rangelands may be from channels.
	This paper describes a study in southeastern Colorado on sedimentation from
	rangeland watersheds. The observed rates are compared to predicted erosion rates
	from a locally developed erosion model, RUSLE, the WEPP model with typical
	rangeland vegetation and soil scenarios, and the rangeland predictions from the Forest
	Service WEPP interface and database. The local regression model and the Forest
	Service WEPP interface best predicted sedimentation from small rangeland watersheds.
	RUSLE overpredicted sediment yields by a factor of 3, and the WEPP
	rangeland predictions were 1/6 the observed sediment yields. In a sensitivity analysis
	with the FS WEPP interface, as cover increases, differences in runoff and erosion between soils decreases.

	stability, and aquatic habitat. Presently, the health and viability of fish stocks in the
	northwest US is becoming a critical issue for the government and the general public.
	Improvement of our understanding of forest soil erosion is of pressing importance. The main
	purpose of this study is to evaluate forest road erosion processes using a modeling approach.
	A refined version of WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project), a physically-based,
	distributed-parameter erosion prediction model, was chosen as the foundation for the
	modeling effort. A segment of an insloping forest road with an impoundment or surface
	cross drain structure, together with the roadside ditch channel and a waterway channel
	below the drainage structure, was conceptualized and modeled as a small watershed. WEPP
	was applied to simulate gross sediment yield within the watershed and sediment delivery at
	its outlet. Different road system configurations with respect to the density of the drainage
	structures along a road and downslope road gradient were examined under climate and soil
	conditions for a representative forest watershed in Idaho State. Soil erosion and delivery
	ratios resulting from the two road drainage system designs were compared. In addition, cost
	analyses based on the standard information about material and labor cost were performed
	to identify road drainage structure designs that can lead to minimized soil erosion and
	sediment delivery, while proving economically justifiable. Results from this study show that
	WEPP is a useful tool in predicting water erosion from insloping forest roads with
	impoundment or cross drain structures as well as in helping establish optimum road drainage system designs.

$Abstract=With the growing public use of the national forests, forest engineers,
	managers, and planners have had the challenge of maintaining extensive road
	networks, while minimizing the ecological impacts of those road systems on the environment.
	Properly spacing road drains for soils, topography, and slope conditions
	can reduce erosion from road surfaces, subsequently reducing sedimentation risk elsewhere.
	Knowledge about the amount of soil eroded and delivered from the road
	system is valuable when making decisions about road drainage design or redesign.
	The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model, a process based erosion
	model that can be used to simulate low volume road erosion, was used to create a database
	of erosion estimates for 72,900 different road configurations, locations, and soil types.
	This database was then used to derive equations for low volume road erosion and runoff.
	A multivariate regression was used to derive equations for road soil loss, road
	runoff, and sediment yield. The resulting equations provided estimates of road soil
	loss and road runoff values within +/- 20% of the original database values. This
	approach also was attempted for sediment delivery across a buffer with less success.
	This is possibly due to complications from antecedent moisture conditions, vegetative
	cover, and sediment loading in runoff.

$Abstract=This study investigated the sediment production from various aggregates.
	The objectives of this study were
	 1) to evaluate the erodibility of a range of aggregate surfacing
	materials and relate it to standard and non-standard specification tests,
	 2) provide a means of specifying aggregate materials and understand the sedimentation implications, and
	 3) to provide a relative ranking of the erosive potential of aggregates.
	To accomplish this,
	eighteen aggregates from the Pacific Northwest were selected based on quality and
	geologic parent material. A suite of aggregate specification tests were performed to
	characterize each aggregate. The sedimentation from a simulated rain storm on a plot
	representing a freshly constructed road section was measured. Traffic was applied and the
	sediment production from a simulated storm was again measured. The two best indicators of
	aggregate quality were Sand Equivalent and Oregon Air P20 test results. Knowledge of
	whether an aggregate was classified as good or marginal was not sufficient to estimate
	sediment production. The best indicator of sediment production was the percent passing the number 30 sieve.

$abstract=Increasing pressure on natural resources has extended forest land management activities into remote moutainous areas.
 Forest roads are an essential element for forest and watershed management.
 However, forest roads are also a major source of sediment production.
 <br><br>
 We used the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model to predict sediment from the roads in a timber sale on the Boise National Forest, Idaho.
 The outsloped 4.4 km road was divided into road segments of different lengths, using three levels of detail (high, intermediate, and low).
 Results from each set of runs were assessed to determine what level of detail was necessary.
 For the high detail method, the road segments were identified by changes in road grade and azimuth angle.
 This resulted in 145 segments with an average length of 31 m.
 Buffer slope was determined from 40 ft (12 m) contours along the flow path, with an average buffer length of 370 m.
 For the intermediate detail method, the criterion was less than 2 percentage points of road grade difference between, resulting in 91 segments with an average length of 49 m.
 Buffer slope was measured where major slope breaks occurred along the flow path, with an average buffer length of 360 m.
 For the low detail method, the road segments were identified by road grade reversal.
 This resulted in 41 segments with an average length of 110 m.
 The horizontal distance and elevation difference between two points, road and stream, were measured for each segment.
 The average buffer length was 320 m.
 <br><br>
 The results of this study indicated that road grade reversal was a sufficient criterion for input information for the sediment produced from the roads.
 Buffer slope information required considering major slope breaks.

$Abstract=Prescribed fire is used as a site treatment after timber harvesting.
  These fires result in spatial patterns with some portions consuming all of the forest floor material (duff) and others consuming little.
  Prior to the burn, spatial sampling of duff thickness and duff water content can be used to generate geostatistical spatial simulations of these characteristics.
  Results from field studies indicated that spatial patterns of duff characteristics occurred, and they were then modeled by kriging, simulation and a trend-surface modeling technique.
  The higher elevations of the study unit burned more severely than the lower portion.
  This is believed to be due to both the heat generated by the fire drying out the upper portions of the units, thus consuming more duff material, and the thinner preburn duff thickness due to ground-based harvesting techniques.
  Attempts to predict duff consumption and subsequent post-burn duff thickness were successful using a trend surface model developed for this site and a general duff consumption model.
  Knowledge of spatial patterns of duff remaining may help land managers adjust prescriptions and alter ignition patterns to reduce areas where total consumption of duff might occur.

$Abstract=Low-volume roads can be a major source of sediment to streams in forest watersheds.  
 For soil erosion from roads to be economically mitigated, the processes that cause erosion need 
 to be understood.  The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP), a physically based erosion and 
 sedimentation model, was used for predicting erosion from forest roads that can be described as 
 hillslopes.  Watershed applications of WEPP predicted erosion and sedimentation values for insloping 
 roads that can be described as microwatersheds.  How well WEPP models insloping roads through a 
 sensitivity analysis and validation process using two studies in the Oregon Coast Range is discussed.

$Abstract=Low-Volume roads are recognized as one of the primary sources of sediment in many watersheds.
 The authors have carried out research on the details of the complex soil erosion processes occurring on
 low-volume roads for more than 10 years.  An overview of their research summarizes the results of 
 numerous past and ongoing field and computer modeling studies on road erosion processes and the 
 effects of road design on road erosion.  The authors have found that insloping and outsloping 
 effects on roads are often overshadowed by the effects of rutting.  Most  soil erosion on roads 
 is from concentrated flow in ruts or ditches.  Adding gravel increases hydraulic conductivity and
 reduces erosion.  Road erosion rates can also be decreased by reducing tire pressure or by removing
 roads.  The authors are developing applications of the Water Erosion Prediction Project model as
 user-friendly erosion prediction tools for road managers.  Further work is required to quantify the 
 effects of current management techniques on water quality and to develop new low-impact road design 
 and management technology.

$Abstract=Fuel and land management activities in the past century have placed wildland values such as soil and water
 quality at greater risk due to increased soil erosion. Eroded sediment can lead to decreased long-term soil
 productivity and adversely impact aquatic ecosystems.  Higher runoff rates from severely burned landscapes
 can lead to flooding and increased risk to human life and property. Over the past ten years, we have completed
 studies on eight sites in the Northwest and Southeast U. S. measuring erosion impacts associated with
 prescribed burning. We are now carrying out field and laboratory studies addressing knowledge gaps in our
 understanding of fuel management practices on soil erosion, and developing a user-friendly computer interface
 to be able to evaluate the risk and consequences of erosion hazards following wildfires, mitigation treatments,
 and prescribed burns. Specific tasks that we are addressing include: determining hillslope characteristics
 that govern dry ravel processes such as slope steepness, vegetation density, soil texture and disturbance
 impacts; determining the spatial and temporal variability in infiltration and erosion parameters needed
 to predict overland flow and soil detachment after wildfire; quantifying effectiveness of three mitigation practices
 in reducing sediment production for specified design storms following wildfires; and evaluating measured
 erosion rates and estimates of sediment production after wildfires at the upland watershed/catchment 
 scale. Data collection has begun from a burned over catchment and preliminary results will be presented.
 Additional discussion will address methodologies and approaches to evaluate and model erosion risk and hazard.

$Abstract= A computer program can help managers anticipate erosion and sediment delivery attributed to forest roads.
 The watershed version of the water erosion prediction project (WEPP) predicts road erosion rates within
 the observed range but overestimates sediment plume lengths.  The predicted sources of
 sediment from an insloping road are mainly from the road ditch and the downslope
 channel; less sediment comes from the traveledway and the cutslope.  Mitigation
 measures to minimize ditch erosion and channel flow rates will have the greatest 
 effects on reducing sediment delivered from insloped forest roads.

        June&nbsp;1-4, Boston, MA.
	Poster.
$abstract=Erosion rates in a forest environment are generally small except
when the ground surface is disturbed by human or natural causes.
Concentrated flow can detach soil particles if the hydraulic
energy is greater than the erosion resistance of the soil.
In steep forest environments ample hydraulic energy is available to move
the sediment load down slope; thus erosion is generally limited by the
amount of detached sediment available for transport.
The objective of this study was to measure the rill erosion rates for
various surface conditions and slope steepness. 
Rills were allowed to form naturally in each of four surface conditions
[natural cover, low severity burn areas, high severity burn areas, and
skid trails] at two field sites for three replications.
Concentrated flow was projected downslope at
five discharge rates (7, 22, 15, 30, 48 l&nbsp;min<sup>-1</sup>) on
three slopes classes (20, 45, 65 %) for a 4 m length.
Timed bottle samples, velocities, and flow depths were measured for each flow rate.
Results suggest a detachment limiting condition existed with
sediment concentration decreasing with each flow discharge rate.
Calculated erosion rates were greater for the highly disturbed
surface conditions than the less-disturbed surface conditions.

$abstract=Recent fires have renewed interest in fire's effect on different components
 of the ecosystems, particularly erosion and soil productivity.
 Our objectives were to 
  (1) determine hillslope erosion rates after a high severity wildfire in an unmanaged forest stand;
  (2) determine fire's short-term effects on nutrient loss.
 The study site was within an unmanaged forest area in the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest, Eastern Oregon. 
 The fire consumed all downed woody debris larger than 75 mm diameter and all standing 
 trees were killed. In addition the entire forest floor (duff) was consumed, leaving 
 mineral soil exposed to raindrop impact and overland flow.
 Onsite erosion measurements were conducted for four years after the wildfire. Silt 
 fences were used to collect eroded sediment on three slope classes (20, 30, and 60 percent), 
 replicated twice, all within a high severity burn area. Mean first year erosion rates were 
 1.9 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup>, decreasing to 0.1 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> the second year, then to 0.03 Mg ha<sup>-1</sup> the third. 
 No erosion occurred the fourth year. In year one, the 60 percent slope sites produced 
 twice as much sediment as did the 20 percent slope sites. Soil nutrient losses followed 
 the same pattern as the sediment losses. High severity wildfires can produce accelerated 
 erosion and nutrient loss for the first year before establishment of natural regeneration.

$Abstract=In forest conditions, surface runoff and soil erosion are generally low because 
 of the surface litter cover. Hydraulic conductivities are in excess of 15 mm/hr, and erosion 
 rates are generally less than 0.1 Mg/ha. If the litter layer is disturbed, then runoff and 
 erosion rates can increase by several magnitudes. Disturbances can be natural, such as wild 
 fire, or human-induced, such as harvesting or prescription-burning for ecosystem management, 
 where conductivities can drop to under 5 mm/hr, and erosion rates can exceed 20 Mg/ha. Roads 
 adversely impact forest soil productivity by directly reducing the productive area, and by 
 causing the greatest amount of soil erosion. Conductivities of roads have been measured to 
 be less than 1 mm/hr, and erosion can exceed 100 Mg/ha. Harvesting activities 
 reduce surface cover and compact the soil, leading to increased runoff and erosion. 
 Erosion generally decreases productivity of forests by decreasing the available soil 
 water for forest growth, and through loss of nutrients in eroded sediment. The Water 
 Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model is shown to be a useful tool in predicting the 
 erosion impacts of different levels of vegetation removal at harvest, and different levels 
 of compaction. WEPP predicted that the nutrients lost through the organic matter in 
 sediments are significant, but less than nutrient loss through tree removal. Work is 
 ongoing to collect long-term site productivity data from numerous sites to aid in the 
 analysis of forest management on soil erosion and site productivity.

 annual erosion rate occurs during the short period of forest disturbance from fire or 
 harvesting, as common in forest ecosystems. The paper provides an overview of the WEPP 
 model and how it is applied to complex forest conditions. It then gives a review of hydrologic 
 probability analysis methods and builds the case to support a non-parametric method. It 
 describes a new WEPP interface which allows users to easily combine the erosion prediction 
 strength of the WEPP model, the database of forest erodibility properties developed by our 
 research unit, the stochastic features of the CLIGEN climate generator, and a non-parametric 
 probability analysis of the results.

 Physical soil values within the infinite slope equation are evaluated
 within DLISA for possible frequency distributions.
 LISA, the probabilistic computer program, adds a stochastic simulation by
 the Monte Carlo method of these frequency distributions.
 The result from these analyses is a probabilitu of slope failure.
 Potential shallow landslides, such as debris flows, have been evaluated
 since 1987 and can be predicted with DLISA and LISA.

For every storm, WEPP calculates the infiltration and runoff, and soil detachment, transport, deposition, and delivery from the bottom of the hillside. Each day plants grow, transpire, and/or senesce, while plant residue on the soil surface accumulates and decomposes.

$abstract=
 The X-DRAIN model is a user-friendly computer program based on the Water Erosion Prediction
 Project (WEPP) and is designed to estimate sediment yield from roads, landings, skid trails,
 and foot trails as affected by climate, soil, local topography, and transportation system
 characteristics.
 X-DRAIN can be used to determine optimum cross drain spacing for existing or planned roads,
 and for developing and supporting recommendations concerning road construction,
 reconstruction, realignment, closure, obliteration, or mitigation efforts based on sediment yield. The
 model estimates sediment yield produced by a given road or road system by summing sediment
 quantities from each unique road segment or road length between cross drains.
 <br>
 This report provides a brief background of WEPP, discusses applications of X-DRAIN, and details
 examples to assist the field user with software implementation.
 Appendix A contains instructions for installing this application on the PC.
 Included are hardware requirements, application features, and removal of the application from the PC.
 Other appendices provide background information useful for proper application of the model.

$Abstract=The effect of tire pressure on sediment produced by loaded logging trucks operating on low-quality aggregate surfaced roads is analyzed. Rainfall and runoff were measured for three winter seasons with logging truck traffic. Sediment eroded from the road surface from moderately reduced tire pressure road sections averaged 45 percent less than from the highway tire pressure sections. An average reduction of 80 percent was measured from the section used by trucks operating with low tire pressure sections. Because the processes responsible for sediment reduction are not site specific, lowering tire pressures in logging trucks on unpaved roads can reduce the sediment loss from many unpaved road surfaces. The results were used to calibrate the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model. Once calibrated, the model estimated the sediment reduction expected at representative locations for all national forests. The WEPP model demonstrated its ability to be helpful in estimating the sediment reduction from forest roads.

 Geostatistical techniques provided estimates of the ground cover (organic forest floor commonly called duff),
 which was used to classify burned-over hillslopes into low- and high-severity burn conditions.
 Rainfall simulation was conducted and the results indicated variability in two important erosion process parameters:

 <a><i>Describing Insloping Forest Roads With WEPP.</i></a>
$abstract=
 Watershed applications of WEPP can predict erosion and sedimentation values for small watersheds.
 A segment of forest road with a cutslope and ditch may be modeled as a small watershed which drains through a culvert and filters down a forested hillslope.
 The purpose of this paper is to discuss how well WEPP models this type of scenario and
 whether or not the output values are a good approximation of real runoff and erosion from forest roads.
 With this information, recommendations can be made when designing or maintaining forest roads to best control erosion and soil loss.
 <br>
 The area developed for an insloping forest road consists of the cutslope, a ditch, the road, culverts spaced at certain intervals, and the hillslope below the culvert where
 sediment is carried down toward a perennial stream.
 To develop this scenario in WEPP, each element must be developed individually and then linked together in the watershed structure.

$Abstract=Many forest roads are being closed as a step in watershed restoration. 
 Ripping roads with subsoilers or rock rippers is a common practice to increase

 of ripping for reducing runoff and erosion and the potential reduction in slope 
 stability by saturating road fills, it is important to know how ripping changes 
 the infiltration capacity of forest roads. Hydrographs from simulated rainfall 
 on 1 X 1 m plots were analyzed to find the saturated hydraulic conductivity, an 
 indicator of infiltration capacity. I examined saturated hydraulic conductivity 
 for three treatments on two different soils. One road was built in a soil derived 
 from the metamorphic belt series geology of northern Idaho, a soil noted for 
 its high rock fragment content. The second road was built in a sandy soil 
 derived from decomposed granitics of the Idaho batholith. On each soil, five 
 plots were installed on a road before ripping, and nine plots were installed on 
 the same road segment following ripping, four covered with a heavy straw mulch 
 and five without. Three half-hour rainfall events with intensities near 90 mm/hr 
 were simulated on each plot. Results show that ripping increases hydraulic 
 conductivities enough to reduce risk of runoff but does not restore the natural 
 hydraulic conductivity of a forested slope. The unripped road surfaces had 
 hydraulic conductivities in the range of 0-4 mm/hr, whereas ripped roads
 were in the range of 20-40 mm/hr after the second event. Surface sealing 
 and tilled soil subsidence processes are important in reducing the hydraulic 
 conductivity of the soils with repeated wetting. Subsidence appears to be 
 important on the granitic soil, whereas surface sealing was more important 
 on the belt series soil.

 ASAE Paper No. 89-2621.
$abstract=To estimate the rill erodibility of a soil, it is necessary to
 relate observed erosion rates to the hydraulic shear and width of the rill channel.
 The hydraulic shear can be calculated given the hydraulic radius for a given flow condition.
 To find eroding rill channel hydraulic radii, photogrammetric and rillmeter methods were
 used in the Water Erosion Prediction Project cropland erodibility study conducted by the
 Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture.
 The objectives of this document are to describe two methods of measuring the rill shape
 on experimental sites and to compare the resulting rill shape parameter values.
 The photogrammetric method showed larger measurements for hydraulic radii,
 with greater scatter, but allowed for the collection of more topographic data,
 and had greater flexibility than the rillmeter method.
 For the rillmeter method, the mean hydraulic radii varied from 6.2 to 14.3 mm with a 95% confidence interval of +/-4.0 mm.
 For the photogrammetric method, the hydraulic radii varied from 10.2 to 25.6 mm with a 95% confidence limit of +/-9.4 mm.
 We concluded that for a study of this scope, the photogrammetric technology with the
 capability of providing considerably more site data is the preferred method.
 We also concluded that a rillmeter backup is desirable, rather than relying on a single measurement technology.

$abstract=
 In a forest environment, soil erosion can lead to sedimentation which can adversely affect the health of stream channels and reservoirs.
 It has been estimated that in forests between 30 and 100% of the sediment budget comes from surface erosion.
 Less than 10% of the surface erosion is from interrill or raindrop impacts,
 whereas over 90% of the erosion is from rills and gullies.

$abstract=Considerable attention has been focused on the impacts of forest management decisions on
the environment in recent decades. Burning after timber harvest is a common site
preparation technique and its effect on soil erosion is of increasing concern, particularly
on steep terrain. The effects of burning are not uniformly distributed on a hillslope.
Methods are needed to assess the soil erosion potential on spatially-varied hillslopes so
that the risk of adverse effects of management activities on water quality and aquatic
habitat can be evaluated. This study presents a method to address the spatially-varied
surface conditions usually found after a prescribed fire, and their influence on erosion. A
laboratory study determined the factors that influence hydrophobicity, and a method to
model the hydrophobicity effect was developed. Field studies were conducted to
determine the spatially-varied effects of fire, and rainfall simulation was used to
determine infiltration and erodibility parameters for various surface conditions.
Hydrophobic soil conditions after fire occurred more often in dry coarse textured soils
than in fine textured soils. A hydrophobicity index that reduced the hydraulic
conductivity based on the soil texture and soil heating was developed. A forest ground
cover factor based on duff thickness was developed. The amount of duff material
remaining after a fire was the most important factor affecting erosion. As the amount of
duff material remaining increases, erosion decreases. The amount of duff remaining and
management activities were used to determine four different surface conditions after the
fire. Probability distribution functions of the important factors that influence erosion
were developed. A method to model spatially-varied hillslope conditions based on the
sequential simulation techniques is presented.

$Abstract=The sediment production from highway tire pressures, constant reduced tire pressures, 
 and from central tire inflation tire pressures on loaded logging trucks operating on a marginal 
 quality aggregate surfaced road were compared. Rainfall and runoff were measured for three winter 
 seasons with logging truck traffic. Sediment production from the constant reduced tire pressure 
 road sections averaged 45% less than from the highway tire pressure sections. An average savings 
 of 80% was measured from the central tire inflation system tire pressure sections. These results 
 were used to calibrate a physical-process-based erosion model, WEPP. Once calibrated, the model
 was used to estimate the sediment reduction expected at two locations in the United States, one 
 in Brazil, and one in Romania. Since the processes that are responsible for the sediment reduction 
 are not site specific and were modeled by WEPP, we feel confident that lowering tire pressures in 
 logging trucks on unpaved roads can reduce the sediment loss from these road surfaces. 
 The WEPP model can be helpful in estimating the sediment reduction.

$Abstract=In many National Forests, much watershed restoration work involves road removal.
 Most National Forests have more roads than can be maintained with decreased budgets limiting the amount of roads
 that can be removed in any given year.
 Setting priorities for road closure based on the impacts and risks involved in closing, removing, or discontinuing
 maintenance has become a major challenge for forest managers.
 Stability and erosion risks are associated with unmaintained roads, and the same risks are associated with various
 removal strategies, such as culvert removal, surface ripping, outsloping, and recontouring.
 Preliminary studies show that effectiveness of ripping depends on soil texture.
 Culvert failure can lead to road fill instability and failure of catastrophic proportions.
 The WEPP model may be a useful tool for evaluating road-closure options to minimize off-site sedimentation.
 Recontouring the surface without considering long-term subsurface flow impacts may greatly decrease slope stability,
 but well-engineered recontouring will minimize stability risk as well as erosion.

$abstract=
 Natural erosion and sedimentation in forest streams help keep the streams functioning properly.
 However, forest development, harvest, and management require roads to be built and maintained,
 and these roads may create excess sediment.
 Erosion from roads has become a greater concern as forests are developed and as the demand for
 forest management increases.
 Sediment added from these human activities can be harmful to natural stream habitats.
 <br>
 There are many techniques for reducing erosion and sediment transport on roads.
 Graveling travelways, installing water bars or cross drains, and establishing riparian buffer
 zones are usually the most cost effective.
 Field tests have shown that spacing recommendations for these types of controls should be
 based on soil type, topography, road dimensions, road aspect, and climate.
 Therefore, design recommendations for these controls cannot be made on a nationwide or statewide level.

$abstract=
 Disturbed forest lands are prone to increased erosion.
 Predicting the effects of forest operations on surface hydrology and erosion is difficult.
 Hydrologic models have been developed for agricultural conditions, but they may not be valid in forests.
 The WEPP model, a process-based erosion model under development, may have limitations in modeling erosion in forest areas.
 Field research has shown that timber harvest area soil properties may vary widely.
 Validation studies with the Watershed Version of the WEPP model show that as observed, snow melt
 dominates the runoff processes in the Northern Rockies, and that disturbed areas generally have
 a greater influence on runoff and erosion than do undisturbed areas.
 The model overpredicted snow melt rate, and did not allow snow to accumulate, but rather melted any
 accumulation on the first day that was above freezing following a snow event.
 It may be necessary to reduce hydraulic conductivities from those observed on small field plots to obtain runoff.
 A model that better describes the attributes of this region's snowmelt processes and upland hydrology is needed.
 Additional research is also needed for modeling the large spatial variability observed in timber harvest areas.
 Research is ongoing to address all of these forest-specific problems.

$abstract=Debates have been raging in recent years over the benefits of road closure.
 Road closure is an increasingly common practice to achieve a variety of management
 goals including improvement of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and reduction of casual
 human effects on forest environments.
 As with road construction, however, there are some major hydrologic considerations that
 must be considered. 
 The construction and use of a road severely disturbs the soil, increasing runoff rates,
 reducing subsurface water flows, and altering shallow groundwater equilibrium.
 Unfortunately, information needed to understand road prism effects on surface and
 subsurface hydrology is limited.

$Abstract=Several logging road subgrades and cut slopes failed under wet
 conditions in the 1980's on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington.
 Although standard laboratory soil test results did not indicate this
 would occur, field tests showed possible soil failure.
 A majority of these soils were coarse-grained with significant amounts of
 fines (silt and clay).
 Field soil identification methods indicated that these soils had a
 moisture content above the plastic limit; the laboratory test results
 were mostly non-plastic.
 During construction, the soils performed like plastic soils with low
 strength values, although in the laboratory the soils had suitable
 strength values for normal road construction methods.
 An hypothesis that standard laboratory tests for soil strength values do
 not detect organic and/or clay minerals that lead to failure under wet
 road construction conditions on the Olympic Peninsula was proven correct.
 A combined field and laboratory testing procedure was developed for
 identifying these soils.

$Abstract=Erosion rates of recently graded nongravel forest roads were measured under rainfall 
 simulation on five different soils. The erosion rates observed on 24 forest road erosion plots 
 were compared with values predicted by the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) Model, Version 
 93.1. Hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility values were predicted from methods developed for 
 rangeland and cropland soils. It was found that on four of the five soils, runoff values were closely 
 predicted and that the predicted erosion was not significantly different from the observed erosion 
 when using rangeland methods for predicting soil erodibility. It was also found that interrill 
 erosion rates were underpredicted using rangeland methods for predicting soil erodibility, but 
 slightly overpredicted when using cropland interrill erodibility prediction methods. Rill erosion 
 rates for road wheel ruts were closely predicted from rangeland rill erodibility algorithms.

 There is an increased awareness of the importance of maintaining the global ecosystem with 
 all its biologic diversity. The USDA Forest Service manages large areas of the nationï¿½s forestlands 
 and has an ongoing commitment to apply the best technology available in its management processes. 
 One of the areas of concern in the forest ecosystem is the amount of sediment eroded from forest roads
 into waterways that serve as spawning and rearing habitats for fish and as habitats for aquatic 
 macroinvertebrates. The authors have been participating in the development of the Water Erosion 
 Prediction Project (WEPP), a major interagency research and model development project. The major 
 thrust of the WEPP project has been to predict soil erosion for agricultural and rangeland conditions. 
 Further research is being conducted to apply the WEPP model to forest roads and harvest areas.

$abstract=Disturbed forest lands are prone to increased erosion.
 Predicting the effects of timber harvest on surface hydrology and erosion is difficult.
 Hydrologic models have been developed for agricultural conditions, but they may not be valid in forests.
 The WEPP model, a process-based erosion model under development, may have limitations
 in modeling erosion in timber harvest areas.
 Field research has shown that timber harvest area soil properties may vary widely.
 However, the range of variation observed in the Southeastern United States is similar
 to the range observed in the Northern Rocky Mountains.
 The WEPP model accounted for differences in erosion due to management and climate.
 Initial simulations with the model may be overpredicting runoff due to summer storms in the Northern Rockies.
 A model that better describes the unique attributes of this region's upland hydrology may be needed.
 Additional research is also needed for modeling the large spatial variability observed in timber harvest areas.

$abstract=Rainfall simulators are commonly used to estimate erodibility parameters for physically-based erosion models.
 Rainfall produced by the simulators should have kinetic energy delivery rates comparable to
 natural rainfall and the kinetic energy field under the simulator should be uniform.
 We used a calibrated piezoelectric crystal-based instrument to measure the raindrop splash
 power of a modified Purdue rainfall simulator.
 Measurements were taken at several points for three intensities (30, 50, and 100 mm/hr) and
 on a large grid at an intensity of 50 mm/hr.
 Raindrop power varied linearly from 0.116 W/m<sup>2</sup> at a rainfall intensity of 30 mm/hr
 to 0.391 W/m<sup>2</sup> at an intensity of 100 mm/hr, about half of that theoretically
 predicted for natural rainfall.
 On a closely spaced grid under 50mm/hr rainfall, power varied from 0.103 W/m<sup>2</sup> to
 0.292 W/m<sup>2</sup>, a ratio of 1:3.
 The difference between the measured power and the power of natural rainfall and the high
 variability in the kinetic energy field raises questions about the validity of erodibility
 values derived from the simulator.
 Further testing of the piezoelectric crystal instrument will help validate these results.

$abstract=
 Aggregate is placed on forest roads in wet climates to provide structural support for
 traffic and in dry climates to reduce sediment production caused by precipitation.
 In both climates aggregate of suitable quality is often not readily available.
 The substitution of poorer-quality aggregate can cause greater amounts of sediment
 than that produced by good-quality aggregate.
 To measure the differences in sedimentation rates, the Forest Service of the U.S.
 Department of Agriculture conducted a sediment study using two aggregate qualities.
 The study was conducted using natural rainfall and logging truck traffic on an
 aggregate-surfaced road during the winters of 1992 and 1993 in western Oregon and
 using simulated rainfall following the winter of 1993.
 The results showed that the quality of the aggregate made a notable difference in
 sediment production.

 A three year test of Central Tire Inflation System (CTIS) and Constant Reduced Pressure (CRP) methods to

 The average sediment reduction from the use of CTIS was 80% compared to highway tire pressures.
 When using CRP tire pressures, the average sediment reduction was 45% compared to highway tire pressures.
 Both lowered tire pressure systems had shallower, less well defined wheel ruts resulting in less
 frequent road maintenance requirements.

$Abstract=The Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is
developing a process-based model of rainfall-runoff and sediment erosion
on disturbed forest sites, principally forest roads and timber harvest
areas. The basis of the developing model is the Water Erosion Prediction
Project (WEPP) model developed for agriculture and rangelands. The major
challenges in adapting this model to mountainous forest conditions are
differences in parameter estimation techniques, weather prediction,
vegetation effects, and management activities. Simulated and natural
rainfall experiments are used for parameter estimations from forest roads
and timber harvest areas. Several model components and parameter
estimations from field and laboratory experiments are discussed.

 Little quantitative information exists on the hydrologic response to burn severity.
 This study compared the effects of low-severity and high-severity burns on runoff and sediment yields
 during rainfall simulation and during natural rainfall in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.
 Fire severity was largely determined by moisture conditions of the forest floor prior to ignition.
 Runoff and sediment yield variability was high between plots within the same treatment area due to
 differences in forest floor characteristics and infiltration rates.
 Conditions of high-severity resulted when burning was conducted with relatively dry fuels.
 Sediment yields were 40-times greater for the high-severity treatment areas than the low-severity treatment areas.

$abstract=Postharvest residue burning is a common site preparation treatment used in the interior Northwest to reduce forest fuels and
  prepare sites for tree regeneration.
  A study was conducted to measure runoff, sediment production, and nutrient changes caused by broadcast burning of logging slash.
  The site was a northern Idaho mixed conifer forest of western hemlock, grand fir, western white pine, western larch and Douglas-fir.
  A spring burn (1992) consumed about 50 percent of the litter, 22 percent of the humus, and 79 percent of the woody fuels less than 8 cm in diameter.
  Heat penetration into the mineral soil was minimal due to moisture present in the lower duff and mineral soil.
  Temperatures at the mineral soil surface did not exceed 77<sup>o</sup>C.
  Four replications of three, 30-minute simulated rainfall events (50 mm/hr) were used.
  Low erosion rates and nutrient losses were measured from this burn treatment.
  These results could help in making land management decisions concerning timing of burning as related
   to onsite sediment production, fuel reduction and long-term site productivity.

USDA.s Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) was initiated to predict sheet and rill erosion and
to calculate annual sediment production on crop and rangelands. WEPP has been developed to
replace the Universal Soil Loss Equation. Efforts are under way to extrapolate the WEPP cropland
and rangeland model to forest areas. The development of a weather simulator is described, which
will be capable of estimating weather parameters without nearby weather records. Model
parameterization is described for road construction and timber harvest, based on field
experiments. Parameters being addressed include: runoff flow in wheel ruts and drainage ditches;
the effects of gravel surfaces, mulches on fillslopes, rock blankets in drainage ditches, and tire
pressure; and the effects of site preparation on the residual root mass.

 and interrill erodibility values for different conditions found on timber harvest sites. Plots 
 with different surface conditions were subjected to three simulated rainfall events. Conditions
 sampled included bladed skid roads with and without treatments, many pass skid trails, few pass 
 skid trails, low burn severity harvest sites, high burn severity harvest sites, and undisturbed forest.
 Results suggest these conditions can be divided into two or three groups for modeling purposes.

$Abstract=A method to develop erodibility prediction equations was developed
 and tested using published data.
 Published sediment yield data for 21 California forest soils developed using
 laboratory plots subjected to simulated rainfall were used to develop an
 equation that explains 90% of the variation in sediment yield from the plots.
 The predicted sediment yield values can be considered an index of relative
 interrill erodibility because only soil type varied among the plots.
 Sediment yield was a function primarily of soil texture for soils with less
 than 50% Si+Cl content.
 Beyong 50% Si+Cl content, the erodibilityof the soil related more to the type
 of clay: kaolin or smectite.
 The hypothesis proposed to explain the shape of the curve is based on
 aggregate strength under rainfall.
 A second hypothesis that increased silt and clay increases the degree of aggregation of the soil as a whole is rejected.
 Soils with a relatively high smectite clay content had a reduced aggregate
 strength and higher sediment yield when exposed to rainfall than soils with a
 relatively high kaolin clay content.
 The relationship of texture and clay mineral content to erodibility should be
 general and applicable to other soils.

$Abstract=Many existing pseudo-random number generators in commercial software and textbooks are bad.
 I studied the literature to compare methods used in generators of various
 distribution types, and compiled a set of "good" functions which return pseudo-random
 independent sequences of numbers fitting the
   standard uniform,
   triangular,
   general normal,
   lognormal,
   exponential and
   beta distributions.
 They have a consistent calling convention, are intended to be portable
 across hardware and software,
 are coded in a high-level language, produce theoretically defensible
 results and
 allow easy splitting of the sequences into disjoint subsequences.
 <br><br>
 I have described the computational model and given algorithms in BASIC
 for each distribution type.
 Discussion of each distribution type also includes a review of other
 generation methods.
 A test result is given in the comments of the code for each generator to
 help the user ensure that
 the routines have been implemented correctly on his or her system.
 <br><br>
 Plots of running values of mean and variance from returned sequences of 2
 to 600 values for each generator
 show visually the sensitivity of the generators to number of samples.

$Authors=Burroughs

$Publisher=Water Resources Bulletin, AWRA
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Runoff and sediment production was measured under simulated and natural rain from 1x5 m plots
 established on a cutover and burned mixed pine-hardwood site in the Georgia Piedmont.
 Trees on the study site were cut and removed without mechanical disturbance.
 Slash was removed, kiln dried and replaced on the slope, and burned prior to plot installation.
 Three slopes, two rainfall intensities, three rainfall simulations representing
 three soil moisture conditions, and two replicate plots were used.
 The experiment was repeated four times during the period July 1989-July 1990
 to investigate the effects of temporal changes in surface conditions and
 particularly root mat and residual forest floor decomposition.
 Runoff and sediment production from natural rainfall events was also measured
 from these plots from the period February-October 1990.
 Results of all measurements indicate that runoff and sediment production
 were generally low because of the protection afforded by the residual forest
 floor following burning.
 However, temporary hydrophobic conditions caused by a dry organic layer
 produced relatively high runoff rates and high sediment for the first few
 minutes of runoff for some of the simulated rainfall applications.

$Title=The effect of reduced tire pressure on sediment production from a forest road

$Authors=Burroughs, Foltz

$Publisher=USFS
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Two 100-ft forest road section (plots) were bladed and used to measure
sediment production from a loaded logging truck using normal (95 psi) tire pressure
on one section and reduced (70 psi for steering axle and 50 psi elsewhere) tire
pressure on the other. Each insloped road plot was divided lengthwise into two
subplots 100 feet long by 5.7 feet wide to define one wheel track. Three
simulated rainstorms at a rate of 2 inches per hour for 30 minutes each were
applied to each plot before truck travel and three more were applied after truck
travel. Increases in sediment production (kg) from the normal tire pressure
plot ranged from +8% (dry run) to +121% (wet run) for the three rainfall
applications, with an average value of +67%, compared to the reduced tire
pressure plot. Increases in sediment concentration from the normal tire 
pressure plot ranged from +32% (dry run) to +132% (very wet run) for the three
rainfall applications, with an average value of +74%, compared to the reduced
tire pressure plot. These increases in sediment production and sediment
concentration were caused by more concentrated flow, with more erosive power, in
the deeper ruts formed in the normal tire pressure plot.  Soil moisture contents
for 3 of the 4 subplots were greater than the optimum for compaction, but the
higher ground pressures on the normal tire pressure plot caused significant
rutting while the road surface of the reduced tire pressure plot had only minor
ruts.  These tests clearly indicate that the use of VTP has a significant
potential to reduce adverse impcts on water quality.

$Abstract=This study was undertaken to measure sediment production from bounded forest road plots using
simulated rainfall. Runoff and sediment were collected from two paired plots exposed to simulated
rainfall. One plot contained a wheel rut while the other one did not. These two different plots were
used to determine the effects of shallow concentrated flow on the amount of sediment produced.
Sediment production rates from these plots on native surfaced roads are presented. The mean soil
diameter ranged from 0.80 mm to 0.05 mm. Sediment rates on the rutted plots with concentrated
flow ranged from 1300 kg/ha/mm to 300 kg/ha/mm for the 30-minute, 50-mm/hr intensity. Rates
on the freshly graded plots without ruts ranged from 700 kg/ha/mm to 100 kg/ha/mm. A process
based model of sediment armoring, believed to be a major process occurring on unpaved forest
roads, was developed and tested using the information collected from eight sites over a period of
three years.

$abstract=Forest land management activities in the United States have extended and accelerated in the past
 four decades into steep, mountainous lands, and into more economically and environmentally
 marginal operating situations.
 Also, increasing environmental awareness over the last 25 years
 has focused considerable attention on the potential impacts of any forest-based activity upon the
 environment. Of particular concern is soil loss leading to reduction of future forest productive
 capacity, water quality degradation, damage to aquatic ecosystems, and visual degradation.
 In many parts of the nation, particularly the Pacific Northwest, forest land managers have found that
 their management alternatives are constrained by limits on turbidity and sediment concentration
 allowed in receiving streams.
 It is essential that managers have the means to predict, with
 acceptable accuracy, sediment production from alternative road construction and maintenance
 plans and alternative harvest area treatment practices.
  <br><br>
 In 1986, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, initiated the Water
 Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) for use on croplands and rangelands to replace the Universal
 Soil Loss Equation.
 The Forest Service joined the WEPP effort because of our interest in estimating sediment production from disturbed forest lands.
 The WEPP model cannot be used in its present form on forest sites because of the many hydrologic and erosion conditions
 that are not considered in the cropland WEPP model.
 The goal of our work is to develop physical process
 models of onsite runoff and sediment production for use on forest roads and timber harvest areas
 nationwide. To do this, we must develop algorithms to estimate model parameters using easily
 measured site characteristics from field sites across the nation. This "forest model" will become
 an integral part of the general WEPP model.
  <br><br>
 Observations and experience by forest land managers and technical specialists nationwide indicate
 that forest roads are the greatest single source of sediment delivered to receiving streams.
 Probably the greatest volume of sediment produced from Alaska to California and the northern
 and central Rocky Mountains comes from mass erosion associated with forest road construction
 and maintenance.
 A lesser volume comes from surface erosion on the forest road prism, and a
 much smaller volume from landslides and surface erosion on timber harvest areas. Fall and winter
 rains, and spring snowmelt runoff in the west, provide ample energy for surface erosion.

$abstract=The United States Forest Service is developing a surface erosion model for disturbed forest sites,
 principally forest roads and timber harvest areas.
 Simulated rainfall is used on bounded plots of various sizes to generate runoff and sediment production from a wide range of soil textures and land management situations.
 The usual sequence of rainfall at a selected intensity is a 30-minute application with the soil in a dry condition, followed 24-hours later by a second application, then followed as soon as possible by a third.
 Two rainfall intensities are used on forest roads: 25 mm/hr and 51 mm/hr.
 Several rainfall intensities are used on timber harvest sites, ranging from 51 mm/hr to 102 mm/hr.
 Data from simulated rainfall on small field plots, burned and unburned, with and without the residual root mat removed, showed the increases in sediment yield to be expected from severe slash treatment/site preparation burns.
 Field plots on timber harvest areas that were unburned and burned with and without machine compaction provided data on the effects of these treatments under natural rainfall conditions.
 Results of a laboratory study of the hydraulic roughness of overland sheet flow with rainfall and a field study of the hydraulics of concentrated flow in wheel ruts were used in an analytic model of runoff from forest roads.
 Data from a laboratory study of the relative erodibility of wildland soils were used to estimate interrill sediment detachment as a function of soil texture and clay mineralogy.
 Simulated rainfall on bounded road plots up to 38 m long showed that wheel ruts increased sediment production by a factor of two to four over similar unrutted road sections.
 The difference in the increase was a function of relative soil erodibility.

  The tire pressure ranged from
  1.07 times (dry run) to 2.20 times (wet run) for the three rainfall applications, with an average
  value of 1.60. The similar ratio for sediment concentration ranged from 1.31 times (dry run ) to
  2.31 times (very wet run) for the three rainfall applications, with an average value of 1.71.
  These increases in sediment yield and sediment concentration were caused by more concentrated flow,

$Abstract=Evaluating the stability of variable landforms is important for land management planning on forest lands in the western United States and Alaska.
This paper describes a rational means for considering both natural variability and measurement uncertainty in landslide hazard evaluation of both natural slopes, and constructed cut and fill slopes.
Monte Carlo simulation is used to simulate the frequency distribution of the factor of safety on a given landform or slope.
The probability of failure is taken as the relative frequency with which the factors of safety are less than or equal to one.
The simulation program is written for IBM PCs and compatibles, includes a menu-driven user interface, and allows the use of seven different input probability distributions to describe the natural variability and uncertainty of each input variable.

$authorblock=<b>Edward R. Burroughs, Jr.</b>
$Abstract=A continuing Forest Service research effort to study onsite sediment yield from
 forest lands provides information on the relative erodibility of certain geologic parent 
 materials and methods to reduce surface erosion. Simulated rainfall on bounded plots is the
 principal research tool to generate runoff and sediment yield from selected sites. This technique
 is also used to measure the reduction in sediment yield as a percentage of that from an
 unprotected site. Two types of disturbed forest sites are being studied: forest roads and
 timber harvest sites.
  <br><br>
 Graphs are provided to estimate the amount of erosion reduction by selected treatments on road
 cutslopes and fillslopes. Percentage ground cover is the principal variable to reduce surface
 erosion. Where data are available, graphs show estimations of the application rate necessary to
 provide the required amount of ground cover for a selected percentage erosion reduction. For
 some treatments, erosion reduction is also a function of slope gradient and silt content in the
 surface soil. In these cases, an erosion reduction treatment is less effective for steeper slopes and
 siltier soils.
  <br><br>
 The net result of controlling erosion on the various components of the forest road is not the sum,
 or product, of the percentage erosion reduction for each component. Research results are used
 to partition sediment yield from a 100-foot road section consisting of a running surface, ditch,
 and cutslope. This partitioning shows the expected decrease in sediment yield as each
 component of the road is protected, taking into account the contribution from the other
 components. A procedure is presented to design a rock blanket for the road ditch as a function
 of the expected discharge, slope, and ditch shape.

$Abstract=Simulated rainfall was used to generate runoff and sediment yield
 from forest roads and fillslopes built in granitic soils to test the
 effectiveness of various surfacing materials, mulches, and barriers as
 erosion control treatments. An empirical equation is presented and used to
 estimate the relative effectiveness of gravel, dust oil, and bituminous
 surface treatments in reducing sediment yield relative to that of an
 unsurfaced road. The equation uses road grade, surface density, and the D<sub>50</sub>
 of loose soil on the surface to predict sediment yield from unsurfaced roads.
 Gravel, dust oil, and bituminous surfacing reduce sediment yield by factors
 of 4.3, 7.7, and 91 relative to the sediment yield for a comparable
 unsurfaced road. Dense grass cover (97 percent) on 1.5:1 fillslopes reduces
 sediment yield by 99.6 percent of that from a bare slope with a loose soil
 surface. Wood fiber mulch and a sediment barrier of cull logs and logging
 slash reduce bare slope sediment yield by 91 and 87 percent, respectively.

$abstract= The landslide hazard rating system for shallow soils on steep terrain over hard sandstone has three components: ground water response to precipitation, soil shear strength (including root strength), and a factor of safety model. Ground water rise over a hyperbolic-shaped bedrock surface in debris avalanche terrain is empirically derived as a function of easily measured site characteristics. Data on soil shear strength (ï¿½ and c) are based on triaxial tests on samples from sites with a high potential for translational failure. Root strength is the sum of the residual strength of Douglas-fir roots as they decline with time after clearcutting and the passive resistance to sliding of an alder soil-root mass. Driving and resisting forces are calculated for a three-dimensional block using estimated ground water rise for a selected design storm, soil shear strength, and estimated root strength.

$Title=Relative effectiveness of fillslope treatments in reducing surface erosion, Horse Creek Road, Nezperce National Forest, Idaho

$Abstract=Two 70-foot long segments of a 1-1/2:1 fillslope, constructed on
 "border zone" soils, were subjected to repeated simulated rainfall events.
 Water and sediment yield were monitored for a total of 20 runs.
 For each run, about 0.8 inch of precipitation was applied in 23-30 minutes
 with a kinetic energy estimated at about 60% of the energy associated with
 a natural event of this intensity.
 <br><br>
 Both fillslope plots had an existing 6-year old stand of planted
 vegetation consisting primarily of orchard grass, smooth brome, timothy,
 and Idaho fescue.  Aerial cover on plot 1 was 97.1% and the weight per unit
 area of vegetal material was 2.67 tons per acre, with litter comprising 63%
 of the dry weight biomass.  On plot 2 aerial cover was 76.7% and the weight
 per unit area of vegetal material was 1.47 tons per acre, with litter
 comprising 51% of the biomass.
 <br><br>
 Four rainfall applications were made on plot 1 in a vegetates condition
 (three runs on plot 2).
 THe vegetation and sod were stripped from the plot, followed by four
 rainfall applications on the bare soil plot (only one run on plot 2).
 An additional four rainfall application were made on plot 1, protected
 with a wood fiber mulch which provided 80.6% aerial cover, and again with
 a slash filter windrow.
 The windrow provided essentially complete cover on the lower half of the
 fillslope, while the upper half of the slope was in a bare soil condition.
 <br><br>
 In their vegetated condition, plots 1 and 2 respectively reduced sediment
 yields by 99.55% and 99.46% compared to the sediment yields from the bare plots.
 The wood fiber mulch reduced sediment yield by 91% and the slash filter
 windrow reduced sediment yield by 87%.
 <br><br>
 Both the wood fiber mulch and the filter windrow provide good immediate
 protection of the fillslopes following construction until planted grass
 can become established.
 Once fillslopes become well vegetated, sediment yields are reduced to about
 0.5% of thoose from bare slopes.
 <br><br>
 THis study does not reflect the type of detachment and transport processes
 occurring during natural rainstorms or snowmelt.
 Therefore, these data should not be used to extrapolate to seasonal or annual
 sediment production.
 The estimates of relative effectiveness of the fillslope treatments in
 reducing sediment yields are probably realistic for the granitic "border zone"
 materials in the Northern Rocky Mountains.

$Title=Surfacing to reduce erosion of forest roads built in granitic soils

$Abstract=
 Over much of the northwestern United States, easily accessed timber stands
 have been roaded and many of the remaining timber stands are on steep sites
 with fragile soils where watershed and fishery values are high.
 Although erosion control is an important consideration in forest road
 construction, we have limited capability to estimate sediment yield from
 forest roads or to evaluate the effectiveness of erosion control treatments.
 This paper describes a series of studies on this subject conducted
 cooperatively by the Engineering Research Project, Intermountain Forest and
 Range Experiment Station, Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture and
 the Civil Engineering Department, University of Idaho. The ultimate goal of
 this research effort is to develop technology for engineers to design
 cost-effective erosion control treatments for forest roads.
 <br><br>
 Several runoff and sediment yield models are available for adaptation to the
 forest road situation. These are: Road Sediment (ROSED) (Simons and others
 1977, 1979; Li 1979), which is a detailed process model; and Simplified Road
 Sediment (SIRSED) (Simons and others 1976), which is a simplified version of
 ROSED. Required input data for these models is the geometry of the proposed
 road, expected climatic events, and several soils characteristics.
 ROSED and SIRSED require field calibration to relate site characteristics to
 parameters used in each model. These models may be calibrated by instrumenting
 road sections to record rainfall, runoff, and sediment yield. This approach
 is expensive and subject to the vagaries of the weather, and will require
 several years of operation to accumulate a reliable data set.

$Title=Experience with a process-oriented road sediment model
$Year=1982
$Authors=Burroughs
$category=erosion modeling
$Publisher=Water Resources Publications
$authorblock=
$Abstract=Simulated rainfall events were applied to selected sections of
 mine haul roads to generate surface runoff and sediment for testing of
 ROSED (<b>Ro</b>ad <b>Sed</b>iment Model). ROSED is a process-oriented runoff and
 erosion prediction model developed at Colorado State University.
 Parameter needs for ROSED determined the format for collection of
 field data
 <br><br>
 A definite improvement in sediment prediction accuracy was obtained
 by modifying model input to simulate wheel ruts, where applicable, in
 addition to the side ditch. Total runoff volume could be predicted
 within +/-20 percent for 75 percent of the rainfall events, and runoff
 peak flow within +/-10 percent for 67 percent of these events. Total
 sediment yield could be predicted within +/-25 percent for 62 percent of
 the rainfall events.
 <br><br>
 Recommendations for improved field techniques for road erosion
 studies include: additional rain gages outside the plot boundary for
 more accurate rainfall distribution maps; and multiple event marker
 equipment to record beginning and ending of rainfall and runoff,
 rainfall intensity, and dye travel time all on a common time base.
 <br><br>
 Recommendations for future investigations with ROSED include:
 simulation of more complex runoff surfaces, such as wheel ruts; adjustment
 of model parameters for simulated snowmelt and rainfall with low
 kinetic energy; relationship of hydraulic roughness parameters to site
 characteristics; and the relationship of infiltration paramenters to
 easily measured site characteristics.

$Title=Declining root strength in Douglas-fir after felling as a factor in slope stability
$Year=1977
$Authors=Burroughs

$Publisher=USDSFS

$Abstract=Numbers of roots per unit area of soil and the individual
 root tensile strength for two varieties of Douglas-fir --
 Coast fir (<i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i>) in western Oregon and
 Rocky Mountain fir (var. <i>glauca</i>) in central Idaho --
 decreased rapidly with time after felling.
 Seventy-five percent of the Douglas-fir roots 1 cm or smaller in diameter
 were lost within 24 months after felling in the coastal variety,
 and within 60 months after felling in the Rocky Mountain variety.
 <br><br>
 Numbers of roots per unit area of soil were combined with tensile
 strength of individual roots to estimate total tensile strength per unit
 area of soil.
 Total tensile strength declined from about 1,700 kg/m<sup>2</sup>
 to about 230 kg/m<sup>2</sup> within the first 30 months after felling for roots
 1&nbsp;cm and smaller of the Coast Douglas-fir.
 Total tensile strength
 declined from about 850 kg/m<sup>2</sup> to about 300 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for the same time
 period and root size class of the Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir.
 Coast Douglas-fir roots are stronger than those of the Rocky Mountain
 variety, but decay faster.
 Live strength is a characteristic of the
 variety of fir, but differences in decay rates are probably a function
 of climate.
