<h3>Dry Mulches</h3>

 Straw mulch was first used for post-fire treatments in the 1980's,
 but it was not widely used until 2000 when the number of large high soil burn severity fires began to increase. 
<br><br>
 During the past decade, aerial application techniques for straw mulch have made it possible to apply mulches
 more efficiently and to treat inaccessible burned areas, making it a viable treatment alternative for the large
 fires that occur in the mountainous western U.S.
<br><br>
 There are on-going post-fire treatment effectiveness studies within these burned areas.
 Although few studies have been published, preliminary data indicate that dry mulching can be a highly effective
 post-fire hillslope treatment. 
<br><br>
 Mulch is frequently applied to improve the germination of seeded grasses and a combination of mulching and
 seeding has been more effective than seeding alone at multiple locations
 (Badia and Marti 2000; Bautista and others 2005; Dean 2001).
 The mulch cover enhances seed germination and growth by increasing soil moisture and protecting the seeds
 from being washed down-slope.
<br><br>
 Agricultural straw mulches often contain non-native seed species that can persist and compete with the
 re-establishment of native vegetation.
<br><br>
 Although wood mulching is less common than straw mulching, wood chips, wood shreds, and wood strands
 (thin wood strips manufactured from non-merchantable timber or production waste, such as
 WoodStraw<sup><font size=-1>TM</font></sup>)
 are increasingly being developed and used for post-fire treatment.
 As we look at post-fire stabilization effects over a longer time frame, new approaches that fit into
 ecological restoration schemes are gaining interest.
 This approach promotes the use of dry mulches developed from local, site-specific forest materials
 (wood chips or wood shreds manufactured on site from burned trees, shredded debris from forest-clearing
 or post-fire logging, etc.) for post-fire erosion control.
