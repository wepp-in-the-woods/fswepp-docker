<h3>Erosion Barrier Treatment Effectiveness</h3>

 Robichaud and others 2008b have completed a multi-year, multi-site study of the effectiveness of contour-felled logs
 for reducing post-fire runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields.
 High-intensity rainfall (maximum rainfall intensity for a 10-min period [I<sub>10</sub>] &ge;2-year return period)
 produced most of the measured runoff and sediment yields except in the southern California site where long-duration
 rain events produced most of the runoff and erosion.
 Runoff, peak flows, and sediment yields were significantly smaller in the treated watersheds for smaller rain events
 (I<sub>10</sub> &lt;2-year return period).
 However, and perhaps more importantly, no treatment effects were measured for rain events with larger
 return periods&ndash;the events that produced most of the measured runoff and sediment yields
 (Robichaud and others 2008b).

 Wagenbrenner and others (2006) found LEBs were ineffective in large storms but could be effective for small events
 given sufficient sediment storage capacity.
 Gartner (2003) found that LEBs generally were effective for low intensity rain events observed during the 2 month
 study period.
 In areas where high intensity rainfall is common, treatment decisions do not favor the use of erosion barriers for
 hillslope erosion mitigation.
 However, erosion barriers can be combined with other treatments, such as mulches and/or seeding,
 and may contribute to the overall effectiveness of the treatment.
 Over time, performance decreases, due to loss of sediment storage capacity and breakdown of barrier installation
 (such as loss of ground-barrier sealing, movement of the barrier); as a result, the erosion barriers lose effectiveness.
 If burned hillslopes will be vulnerable to erosion for more than one or two years, an erosion barrier installation
 may not retain enough capacity to be effective with even small rain events.
