<h3>Summary Chart of Treatment Effectiveness</h3>

Ratings of post-fire hillslope stabilization treatment effectiveness for three rainfall regimes 
(high intensity, low intensity, and high total amount; see fig. 4 and Table 1 in main text) 
are presented in the 
table below.

Treatment effectiveness codes: 
<blockquote>
1=more effective;<br>
2=somewhat effective;<br>
3=not effective.
</blockquote>

Treatments are also rated as likely (+) or unlikely (&ndash;) to exhibit characteristics that impact effectiveness, 
post-fire recovery, and/or the environment. 
In some cases treatments are rated +/&ndash; to indicate they are likely to have the characteristic in some circumstances
and unlikely in others. 
Details of treatment performance characteristics can be found in the individual treatment sections of the main text.
