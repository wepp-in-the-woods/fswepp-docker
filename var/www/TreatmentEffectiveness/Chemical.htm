<h3>CHEMICAL SOIL SURFACE TREATMENTS</h3>

 Tackifiers, or soil binding agents, are mixed with fiber, seeds, and/or fertilizer for use in hydromulching and
 hydro-seeding; however, tackifiers may be used alone as a surface soil treatment.
 Soil binders are applied by putting them into solution and spraying them on the soil or by spreading solid granulated
 particles on the soil where they can dissolve in rain and/or overland flow.
